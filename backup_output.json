Fraudsters will often try and make it seem as if a message is coming from a company like PayPal, but something is always a little off. </span><br><span style=\"\"><br></span><br><span style=\"\">&#x201C;Look for red flags such as poor grammar or spelling, and URLs and domains that don&apos;t match the sender,&#x201D; Rosenblatt said. For instance, if there&#x2019;s a PayPal logo on an email but the message appears to have come from an odd website rather than </span><a href=\"http://paypal.com/\" style=\"\">paypal.com</a><span style=\"\">. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">Other warning signs include any email that demands you respond urgently, asks for your social security number or banking information, or includes suspicious attachments.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t click on email attachments unless you are sure of its origins, and don&apos;t click on emailed links unless you know where the link is going,&#x201D; Rosenblatt said.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">If you see a link in an email, don&#x2019;t click on it: It&#x2019;s hard to determine where that emailed link will really take you. In the case of phishing, what you think is a legitimate URL could lead you to a fake website designed to steal your username and password.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Be careful what you post<br></span></strong><span style=\"\">In this social media age, we&#x2019;re all a little more willing to post things like our hometown, pet names and birthday. If you&#x2019;re also using some of those personal details as password reset questions, then you could be inadvertently handing your virtual keys over to an attacker. Be vigilant about what you share online and with whom.</span><br><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><br> Choose unique passwords</span></strong><br><span style=\"\">Good online security starts with a secure password. One fundamental thing you can do to keep yourself protected is to use unique passwords for all your accounts, especially those that include banking information. That way if someone gains access to one of your accounts, they won&#x2019;t get into others as well.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">You should also enable two-factor authentication where possible. With services such as PayPal, you&#x2019;ll be texted a unique code when you log in, so even if an attacker gets your username and password, they still can&#x2019;t access your account.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">If you think your PayPal account might have been compromised</span></strong><br><span style=\"\">Contact us at </span><a href=\"mailto:spoof@paypal.com\" style=\"\"><span \"font-size:12.0pt;=\"\" font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:=\"\" calibri\"=\"\" style=\"\">spoof@paypal.com</span></a><span \"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:=\"\" &quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">, and forward the email in question.

And while cash may still be king (it&#x2019;s still the go-to choice for purchases for more than 60 percent of people surveyed), one-third of people surveyed around the world prefer a mobile wallet to a real one. Traditional payments are going by the wayside - close to 80 percent of global respondents hate writing checks (even more are less interested in carrying their checkbooks). Millennials are embracing peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, and nearly 75 percent of people of all ages feel relief at the thought of using P2P payments to settle debts. </span><br><br>  We just announced <span style=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.paypal.me/\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal.Me</a></span><span style=\"\">,</span> which is a free, simple, and personal way to request money from groups of friends, family and colleagues across the globe.

We were thrilled and encouraged because that ruling marked such an important step forward in the ongoing march toward inclusion, equality, and justice in this country &#x2013; values that are the heart of everything we believe in and strive to achieve at PayPal.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span></div>  <div>  <!--BLOG_SUMMARY_END--></div>  <div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">But clearly, there&#x2019;s still work to do to ensure that all Americans enjoy full equality under the law. According to a recent poll, nearly two-thirds of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans have faced discrimination in their personal lives. Meanwhile, 31 states do not have comprehensive laws that protect citizens from being fired from their jobs, evicted from their homes, or denied credit because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    So it is with great enthusiasm and our strongest support that we commend the introduction of the Equality Act of 2015 in the United States Senate and House of Representatives. The Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity, and ban discrimination in employment, housing, public education, public accommodations, access to credit, and more.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    From the earliest days of PayPal&#x2019;s history as a pioneer of online payments and inclusive ecommerce, the principles and ideals that are embodied in the Civil Rights Act &#x2013; and that would be extended by the Equality Act &#x2013; have been reflected in our vision for the world we aspire to help create. PayPal was founded 17 years ago to make it easier for people to use their money to pursue their dreams, create opportunities in their communities, and build better lives for themselves and their families. This is why we continue to strive to be at the forefront of the digital payments revolution that is opening the financial system and creating new opportunities for all.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    At PayPal, we have always believed that everyone has the right to be treated equally, with dignity and respect &#x2013; which is why we were one of the first companies in California to extend employee benefits to same-sex couples. We encourage companies around the nation and the world to choose to do the same, both as a matter of fairness and good business practices. We know that our competitive advantage comes from the people who work at PayPal, and we&#x2019;ve always prided ourselves on valuing our employee&#x2019;s talent, creativity, and commitment to customers above all else. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    On an even more fundamental level, we believe everyone deserves to live without fear of discrimination or retaliation for simply being who they are. The provisions in the Equality Act that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity will bring us another important step closer to the day when these rights are fully enjoyed by all. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    So we look forward to the passage of the Equality Act and the chance to come together once again to celebrate the expansion of inclusion, equality, and justice.<br><br><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Franz Paasche, Vice President, Corporate Affairs</span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

His Op-Ed discusses what is needed for true financial inclusion worldwide.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">The original commentary posted on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/21/paypal-ceo-time-to-democratize-the-banking-system-commentary.html\" style=\"\">CNBC.com</a> on Tuesday, July 21, and the full text is below. </span><span \"color:=\"\" black\"=\"\" style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><br>--</div>  <div>  <!--BLOG_SUMMARY_END--></div>  <div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">One way to understand human progress is to look at how technology has made products and services &#x2013; once reserved for the elite &#x2013; progressively more accessible and affordable. Personal and mobile computing, long-distance communications, energy storage and air travel are just a few of the things that have been democratized by technology, creating new possibilities for billions of people.<br><span style=\"\"><br></span><span style=\"\">However, financial services is one area where democratization is still far from reality both in the United States and globally. For the truly affluent, checking is free, credit is plentiful and cheap, and fees for dipping below an account balance minimum are seldom a concern. But for everyone else, managing and moving money comes at a price. In the United States, for example, it can cost around $60 a year to maintain a checking account, $3 or more to make an ATM cash withdrawal, and $30 per transaction if you bounce a check.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">The cost of money rises dramatically if you can&apos;t afford to keep it in a bank. Not long ago, I spent a week using only what the banking industry calls &quot;alternative financial services,&quot; relying on check-cashing offices and wire-transfer companies to support my daily finances. The results were deeply dispiriting. Accessing my own money became a part-time job, and the price of each transaction meant my checks yielded less than their value and my bills cost more than they should have.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">What, for me, was only an eye-opening experiment is an everyday fact of life for the 2 billion adults around the world who lack access to basic financial services. The simplest transaction &#x2013; receiving a paycheck, paying bills or sending money to a loved one &#x2013; can be distressingly inconvenient and disproportionately expensive. </span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">Not only is this is manifestly unfair, but it is economically counterproductive. Numerous studies make clear that when people achieve &quot;financial inclusion&quot; &#x2013; defined by the World Bank as having a bank account and using it at least twice a month &#x2013; they are more likely to start new businesses and invest in education. A growing body of research indicates that financial inclusion has a positive impact on economic growth and can help reduce income inequality.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">Today, financial services is primed for the same technological transformation that has revolutionized many other industries. The digitization of money, the rapid proliferation of Internet access and mobile phones have created the perfect conditions to make it easier and cheaper to save, spend, give, and borrow. </span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">The ability to connect people to affordable financial services anywhere and at any time promises to be more than a transformation for the unbanked in emerging economies. </span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">Moreover, history demonstrates that living standards almost always rise when new technologies streamline how people connect to the things they need or want. By making financial services universally affordable and accessible, we have the chance to extend financial citizenship to billions of people worldwide, giving them greater control of their economic destiny and new ways to create opportunities for themselves, their families, and their communities.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">We cannot rely solely on governments and non-profits to address the social needs around us. Those of us in positions of leadership in the business and technology community have the obligation to take action and do our part. And, in doing so, we can be both consumer and shareholder friendly by re-imagining what could be &#x2014; and creating opportunities for real social change. </span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">So, what will it take to create a fair and equal financial system that makes financial services universally accessible and truly inclusive? As companies, governments, nonprofits, and foundations around the globe grapple with this question, the answer must be built on three principles.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">First, it will take open, easy access to digital financial systems and networks. Although mobile devices are now nearly universally available, we still need to close infrastructure gaps in remote and underdeveloped regions where people still lack access to communications networks. We&apos;ll also need to support efforts to provide everyone with a reliable digital ID to use for financial transactions.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">Second, we must guarantee safe and secure digital transmission for all transactions. Whether someone is paying a local bill or sending money to family in another country, they have to be able to do so with complete confidence that their money and personal information are protected.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">And third, we must broaden the basic concept of financial inclusion to include equitable and affordable financial participation in the economy. Full financial citizenship means more than just a savings account and a way to transfer money and pay bills. It also requires access to credit, along with the ability to accept payments and run a business, send money to family or transact business across borders, contribute to the community and help others in need, and invest for the future.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">Working through all of the technical, economic and regulatory barriers to make this all possible will require clarity of purpose and an unusual degree of public and private collaboration across the financial and business sectors. </span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">But it can be done &#x2014; and the effort will be worth it. </span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">People work hard for their money, and they want to be treated fairly and equally, regardless of how much they earn, save, or spend. The good news is that the technology platforms exist to create regional and global financial systems that are fair, safe, and universally accessible. As the private and public sectors work together to extend affordable financial services to all, the benefits and progress we can achieve for people globally will be enormous.</span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <em style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Commentary by Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal.

We&#x2019;ve entered a time of unprecedented change that will revolutionize the role that money plays in people&#x2019;s lives. Right now, every aspect of commerce is being rewired on a global basis. The convergence of mobile technology and cloud computing is unleashing incredible opportunities to transform how people move and manage money, and how merchants and consumers interact and transact.

In 1998, PayPal was a driving force behind the rapid adoption of e-commerce by pioneering a safe and convenient way to send money via email. Four years later, we went public under the stock ticker symbol PYPL. Now after more than 12 years as a part of the eBay family, we&#x2019;re thrilled to be publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange once again under our original stock ticker. As we mark our start as an independent company, we wish our friends and colleagues at eBay nothing but the best in the future.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin\"=\"\" style=\"\">PYPL is a meaningful symbol for PayPal. It signifies our unbroken commitment to the original vision that sparked the launch of this company. It represents our vast global payment network and our worldwide community of consumers, merchants and developers. It stands for our heritage as an innovator in digital payments &#x2013; everything we do to make financial transactions easier, faster and more affordable.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <strong style=\"\"><span \"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin\"=\"\" style=\"\">Our Opportunity is Enormous</span></strong><br><span \"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin\"=\"\" style=\"\">Now, as we move forward as an independent company, our opportunities have never been greater. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin\"=\"\" style=\"\">We operate in the fast-growing online and mobile segments of digital payments, which combined form a $2.5 trillion e-commerce market*.

It begins with what we&#x2019;ve achieved so far. We serve more than 169 million active customers through our open digital payments platform. Last year we processed 4 billion payments for people living in places as big as China and as small as Vatican City, connecting them to the world and to each other to send nearly $235 billion through our secure payments network. Sometimes this means doing the everyday things in simpler, safer ways like buying new shoes, paying for a ride or selling something on eBay. People also trust PayPal to make more meaningful connections, and donate hundreds of millions of dollars to causes they care about and send money to friends and family, no matter if they live in Atlanta or Antarctica. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin\"=\"\" style=\"\">We create opportunities for entrepreneurs. On a typical day PayPal customers help to crowd fund almost $1 million to support new ideas.

Managing a lemonade stand (a first job for many) teaches youngsters the fundamentals of running a business -- including planning, launching, location, pricing, marketing, customer relations, profitability and even competition!&#xA0;</span></div>  <div>  <!--BLOG_SUMMARY_END--></div>  <div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">To help the youngest of entrepreneurs learn how to establish, grow and scale their businesses, I&#x2019;ve put together a list of 7 tips for running the coolest (and most profitable) lemonade stand on the block:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><ol><li><strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Location, location, location</strong><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">. Set up your lemonade stand in a safe location that experiences heavy foot traffic. If you live on the end of a long and windy road, consider moving your stand to the top of the street where more bikers, walkers and runners are likely to pass by.</span><br></li><li><strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Think beyond dollars and cents</strong><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">. Not everyone carries cash or quarters these days. However, portable mobile card reader solutions, like </span><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" title=\"\">PayPal Here</a><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">, can help ensure you never miss a sale (or a tip!) by enabling you to accept credit card payments wherever you decide to set up for the day.&#xA0;</span><br></li><li><strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Keep an eye on sales trends.</strong><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"> When do you see the most customers? It&#x2019;s important to track your sales data, including sales spikes for the day, week and month. This will help you decide the best time to pop up shop, or if you can take a break and sneak in your favorite cartoon. When you&#x2019;re just starting out, you can keep track of your sales on a pad of paper, but when your business starts to take off, companies like PayPal can help you view and track your growing sales.&#xA0;</span><br></li><li><strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Customer service is key</strong><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">. People expect quick and friendly customer service. In a business where the product &#x2013; lemonade &#x2013; is similar to what competitors offer, providing on-the-fly discounts to your shoppers &#x2013; like buy three glasses get one free &#x2013; shows you value their business and also encourages larger spending, cha-ching! Offers like these can also lead to repeat purchases.</span><br></li><li><strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Use customer feedback</strong><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">. Be constantly on the lookout for customer feedback about your business. Survey your shoppers to see if they are interested in purchasing other items to go with their lemonade, like branded koozies to help soak up condensation from their cups, a bottle of water or some homemade chocolate chip cookies.

This means we&#x2019;re gaining share across the globe as we partner with the world&#x2019;s top retailers and many of the leading next-generation commerce pioneers. It&#x2019;s also a clear sign that PayPal is at the forefront of the once-in-a-generation transformation that is sweeping across our industry and changing the way that people shop and pay. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin\"=\"\" style=\"\">As we get ready to move forward as an independent company, there are plenty of additional signs of the power of PayPal. We&#x2019;re one of the 10 most-trusted brands in a number of countries, and we&#x2019;re far and away the top choice for U.S. consumers who plan to make their first mobile payment in a store in the next six months.

The acquisition of Xoom will enable PayPal to provide simple, safe and affordable digital money transfer services to millions of people around the world in the large and growing international remittance market. And it marks an important step forward as we pursue our strategic vision to provide new ways for people to use PayPal in their everyday financial lives by making the movement and management of money work better for everyone. </span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span \"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin\"=\"\" style=\"\">For the last 17 years, PayPal has distinguished itself as an innovator and leader through our ability to harness the power of digital technology to enable people to use their money to connect to the things they care about more easily. As we enter the next phase of our history, our opportunities to build on this legacy and improve people&#x2019;s lives have never been greater.

As part of this, we support entrepreneurs and small businesses, and allow them access to cutting edge tools. One of the benefits of using PayPal is that nearly anyone can sign-up for an account and start accepting payments in seconds.

When you presell &#x2013; you are setting a condition with your customer that they are purchasing a product or service before it is available, and there is an expectation that your customers will get something tangible for their money, even if the delivery is delayed. It is important to note: with a presale, customers are charged for a product that&#x2019;s still being developed. </span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:=\"\" &quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">With crowdfunding, the expectation is that customers are putting money in a campaign and they face a risk of not getting what they expect. Crowdfunding is similar to an investment. There is hope it will be successful, but there is no guarantee of a product or service. Our point of view is that campaign owners are still responsible for making that clear to consumers, so they are fully informed before putting money into a crowdfunding campaign.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:=\"\" &quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">We collaborate with several crowdfunding platforms, such as Indiegogo and Fundrazer, to offer entrepreneurs the option of raising money from the public. Our policy with businesses and campaign owners on these crowdfunding platforms is that sellers get a quick release of the funds raised as long as they put a clear disclaim about the risks for buyers. But, when a seller chooses to presell merchandise independently of these platforms, PayPal takes the steps below to help protect its customers as well as itself. </span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:=\"\" &quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">Occasionally, businesses that presell items run into unexpected problems that leave them unable to deliver what was promised and can even put them out of business. This puts PayPal in a tough spot when something goes wrong, and one of our highest priorities is to help protect our customers while creating a positive experience. We want businesses to get paid and we want the customer to get what they ordered.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:=\"\" &quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">That&#x2019;s why when a business presells merchandise more than 30 days in advance, </span><span \"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;=\"\" font-family:&quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;times=\"\" roman&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">we may hold a percentage of the seller&#x2019;s funds to help ensure that buyers receive the product or service they paid for within the agreed timeline, or a get a refund if the product isn&#x2019;t available. That being said, we understand that a seller may need additional funding to run its business or make a product, so we will work with sellers on a case-by-case basis to release additional funds. All a seller needs to do is contact customer service and provide proof &#x2013; such as pay stubs for employees or invoices for suppliers. </span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span \"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:=\"\" &quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;times=\"\" roman&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">We don&#x2019;t want to get in the way of the innovative new products or services consumers want, but we want to ensure both buyers and sellers have our trust. </span><span style=\"\">It&#x2019;s about helping to protect our customers, to ensure they get the items they ordered.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: initial;\">Sid Pershad, Director of Risk Management, PayPal</span><br><span></span><br><span></span></span><span \"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" mso-fareast-font-family:calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-ansi-language:=\"\" en-us;mso-fareast-language:en-us;mso-bidi-language:ar-sa\"=\"\"><span></span></span><span></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

The NY-based business was founded by seasoned guitar player Tommy Colletti in 1994 as a brick-and-mortar operation. As his business grew, Colletti decided to start selling his wares online. His sales skyrocketed once he started to accept <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant?&amp;mpch=ads&amp;mplx=3484-200465-8030-76\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PayPal</a>&#x2013; and The Music Zoo became one of the country&#x2019;s top destinations for guitar enthusiasts. Today, PayPal processes 80 percent of the store&#x2019;s sales, either online for credit card and PayPal transactions, or through the PayPal Virtual Terminal for phone orders. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Colletti loves how PayPal gives his business quick access to funds stating: &#x201C;With our old processor, the money would reach our bank account 3 to 5 days later. With PayPal, we charge the customer and we almost can usually see the money the next morning. That quick access to our cash has been a huge help.&#x201D; &#xA0;In addition to employing PayPal for payments processing, The Music Zoo offers <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/billmelater-productoverview\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PayPal Credit</a>. &#xA0;Shoppers can finance purchases of $99 or more through the service, without payments or interest if the balance is paid in full within six months.*<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Today, The Music Zoo is a $10 million, 20-employee small business specializing in professional, customized guitars. But Colletti isn&#x2019;t resting on his laurels. He&#x2019;s looking forward to growing the store&#x2019;s mobile sales capabilities and building a new site with PayPal business partner, <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Shopify</a>. Through it all, The Music Zoo remains an exclusive destination for lovers of high-end and custom guitars &#x2013; and PayPal is a cornerstone of its online sales. Looking back, Colletti says, &#x201C;The confidence consumers have in PayPal affects our business in every way. PayPal has been, hands down, the best choice for us. It&#x2019;s just a great business relationship.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    <em style=\"\">*PayPal Credit (formerly Bill Me Later&#xAE;) is subject to consumer credit approval, as determined by the lender, Comenity Capital Bank.

A common example is when an email account is hacked.

Many people have experienced fraud in the form of illegitimate charges to their credit cards or bank accounts.&#xA0; Fraud is often the result of a hack or a breach. In 2014, several companies experienced significant data breaches, which resulted in millions of email addresses and credit card numbers being stolen. Soon after, many people began seeing charges to their credit cards that they had not authorized; the term fraud applies to the act of these charges being made without the authorization of the card older.&#xA0;</span><br></li></ul><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    At PayPal, we are committed to protecting your financial information from breaches or hacks and to prevent fraud before it ever affects your account. &#xA0;Our proprietary security and fraud prevention systems are among the most advanced in the industry, and because PayPal doesn&#x2019;t share our customers&#x2019; financial information with merchants, an extra layer of privacy is built into our service. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    We know it&#x2019;s impossible to eliminate the bad guys completely, so we work to be very good at detecting and blocking the bad guys, so they move onto easier targets. <span style=\"\">Our system gets smarter with every transaction we process (we&#x2019;ve processed billions to date), allowing us to accurately establish patterns to trust the good people and to spot the bad ones.&#xA0; Because of these systems, PayPal has one of the lowest fraud loss rates in the industry, at 0.32%, or less than one third of one percent. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  PayPal is also helping to lead industry-changing initiatives to make <a href=\"http://insights.wired.com/profiles/blogs/the-evolution-of-authentication\" style=\"\" title=\"\">authentication</a> easier and more secure without sacrificing privacy, such as the <a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/PayPal-Leads-Industry-Effort-to-Move-Beyond-Passwords/ba-p/782652\" style=\"\" title=\"\">FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance</a><span style=\"\">.</span> We pushed forward the initiative in 2013 and now have over <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/about/board/\" style=\"\" title=\"\">150 members</a> including Google, Samsung and Microsoft.

At the event, dozens of incredible women shared their words of advice for new entrepreneurs. They shared their perspective on what it takes to be successful, stating &quot;tenacity&#x201D; and &#x201C; willingness to fail&#x201D; as critical attributes. These women are challenging the status quo and taking risks to pursue their creative endeavors. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">There was such a wide range of women who had made changes in their lives along their entrepreneurial path.

Most stores make the couple&#x2019;s list available online and keep track of which items have already been purchased so that there are no duplicate orders. To give you an idea of how much to spend, Jamie Miles, assistant managing editor of The Knot.com, says that on average, friends spend around $79 on a wedding gift, while family members spend double that amount. <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/yhosseinzadeh/Documents/Blog/Summer%20Wedding%20-%206.9/PayPal%20Forward_Summer%20Wedding%20Season_IR%20Legal%20Approved.docx#_edn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>If that&#x2019;s outside of your budget, consider co-gifting with a friend or date and have them send you money via PayPal. &#xA0;</span><br></li></ul><span style=\"\"></span><ul><li><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">&#xA0;</span><strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Get the Party Started &#x2013; </strong><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">When you&#x2019;re a groomsman or bridesmaid, expect to be invited to the bachelor or bachelorette party.

Whether you&#x2019;re along for the ride or in charge of rallying the troops, be prepared to split costs while covering the bride or groom&#x2019;s portion. If you&#x2019;re the best man or maid of honor, you may want to price everything out in advance and ask your friends to pay you on the PayPal mobile app before the wild weekend.

To help protect against fraudulent transactions, we have Purchase and Seller protections for eligible purchases.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Our loss rate, our expenses due to fraudulent activity compared to our revenue as a whole, is one of the lowest in the industry, at 0.32% or approximately one third of 1%. A key reason why we&#x2019;ve been so successful is because of the holistic approach we take when it comes to security and fraud prevention. At the core of these efforts is our Enterprise Fraud Management System (EFM). <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    In 2009, our global risk management organization embarked on a journey to build a complete Enterprise Fraud Management System in-house. Now complete, this EFM system allows us to work with vast amounts of rich data to help keep fraud at some of the lowest levels and our customers transactions secure. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    A lot went into building the best EFM system to do so. There were some key considerations we kept top-of-mind to keep our customers secure, and based on our experiences, we wanted to share some key learnings.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    <ul style=\"\">  <li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Keep it Simple. </strong>With isolation      comes innovation. Isolate      problems and make sure to solve one at a time. When building our systems,      we made sure to not get caught up focusing on the perfect final product.      We started with one area, and made it work end-to-end before working on      other challenges. Building systems one stack at a time, allows you to      easily identify problems, and nip them in the bud.</li> </ul>    <ul style=\"\">  <li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Test and Learn.</strong> At PayPal, we have      to make our risk decisions in milliseconds. To create a system that      accurate, it takes a lot of testing and learning. We are constantly      layering on enormous amounts of data, to create the best system. We detect      suspicious behavior using thousands of characteristics, but are still able      to correlate whole events in seconds, as compared to hours for the rest of      industry.</li> </ul>    <ul style=\"\">  <li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Strike a Balance.</strong> The best      enterprise fraud management solution balances analytical and engineering      knowledge. Cross-functional teams are imperative. Our teams are comprised      of data scientists, engineers, project managers and business minds. When      building your system, you cannot sacrifice systems or data scientists. It      takes everyone to find the best solution.</li> </ul>    <ul style=\"\">  <li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Don&#x2019;t Underestimate Intelligence. </strong>PayPal      can detect suspicious behavior using thousands of characteristics &#x2013; device      type, dollar amount and much more. But we don&#x2019;t just rely on the data &#x2013; we      have developed our own unique ways of using a human detective-like      approach to help identify even the most hidden nuances. Combining advanced      machine learning and data mining with a human oversight and approach, will      be more successful than just trying to tackle the data alone. </li> </ul>    <ul style=\"\">  <li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Never Stay Still. </strong>&#xA0;It is important to keep an open mind for      new generations. Always be listening, and be prepared for the next      challenge. We like to call it futureproofing. PayPal has a team dedicated      to developing innovative risk techniques for technologies that are three      to five years from becoming mainstream &#x2013; for example we developed      algorithms for mobile approximately five years ago, and are now better      positioned to help protect consumers from fraud attempts on mobile      platforms.</li></ul><br>     At PayPal, we believe every transaction tells a story &#x2013; which is unique from the way most companies evaluate transactions. These stories guide us on our journey to the next generation of enterprise fraud management. We have already started looking ahead, and make it a best practice to stay one step ahead &#x2013; instead of constantly trying to catch up. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    With our systems, we are able to grow and evolve, changing risk rules and models to better protect our customers now and in the future. <br><br>Hui Wang, Sr. Director, Global Risk Sciences, PayPal<br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

About a quarter of our total payment volume is cross-border and 79% of shoppers in the US, UK, Germany, Brazil, China and Australia choose PayPal as their preferred method of global payment. The China corridor is one that is growing particularly fast. Since Singles Day 2014, top brands selling into China are seeing 1600%+ YoY growth in the China corridor with PayPal. According to research commissioned by PayPal in 2015, Chinese cross-border shoppers have an increasing appetite for a greater variety of authentic products and access to global brands. To address these customers, we are launching PayPal China Connect, which will link Chinese consumers directly with our network of global merchants. We are also announcing a new collaboration with UnionPay International to provide Chinese cross-border shoppers with a more robust lineup of global merchants on the UnionPay Shop The World website, and fewer steps to complete their transactions via UnionPay Online Payments.</span><br></li></ul><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <strong style=\"\"><span \"font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;=\"\" color:black\"=\"\" style=\"\"><font size=\"4\">Mobile</font></span></strong><br><ul style=\"\"><li \"color:black;margin-bottom:10.0pt;mso-list:l2=\"\" lfo2;=\"\" tab-stops:list=\"\" .5in;vertical-align:baseline\"=\"\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><span \"font-size:=\"\" 11.5pt;font-family:&quot;arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"=\"\" style=\"\">Extending One Touch&#x2122;:</span></strong><span style=\"\"> Today, we      extended our One Touch checkout experience by linking our One Touch web      and mobile experiences.

We&#x2019;ve been a driving force behind the expansion of e-commerce ever since &#x2013; both online and via mobile devices. Today, online and mobile shopping accounts for $2.5 trillion in annual retail sales. PayPal processes nearly 12.5 million payments for our customers every single day.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    That&#x2019;s a nice piece of a large and growing market. But the real potential is many times larger. We believe that the most important trend in business right now is the convergence of online and physical world commerce through mobile experiences. Together, they form a unified world of commerce worth $25 trillion. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    This convergence has profound implications. It&#x2019;s not simply about tapping your phone to pay instead of handing over cash or a swiping card. It&#x2019;s about reinventing how people spend and save, and making it simpler and safer to move and manage money. It&#x2019;s about reimagining the retail experience so that shopping is more personal, more convenient, and more secure. It&#x2019;s about rethinking financial services so that everyone, everywhere can access the financial services they need to live the lives they dream about. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Right now, we&#x2019;re in the greatest period of disruption and transformation in the history of money. One clear sign that these changes are already well underway &#x2013; a couple of years ago, 50 percent of the money that passed through consumers&#x2019; wallets was cash or checks. A couple years from now, physical money will account for just 25 percent of transactions. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Mobile technology is driving this transformation &#x2013; no technology has ever achieved mass adoption as quickly. PayPal was at the forefront of this transformation and today, PayPal is creating the operating system for digital commerce. Our vision is to be an everyday part of consumers&#x2019; financial lives and serve as a comprehensive payment partner for merchants. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Because we built one of the world&#x2019;s leading open digital payments platform, we&#x2019;re in a unique position to achieve this vision. By delivering a platform that is technology and payment agnostic, we&#x2019;re making it possible for people to move and manage their money whenever they want and wherever they are, on whatever device they have at hand. As all commerce becomes digital, PayPal will be the one solution partner merchants trust to help them create seamless shopping experiences that strengthen engagement with their customers, while protecting their security. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Many companies are working on one piece or another of the complex array of systems and services that make up the world of digital commerce. But PayPal spans the entire digital financial universe &#x2013; from payment processing to digital wallets, merchant accounts to peer-to-peer money transfers, single touch transactions to credit for consumers and merchants, and from risk analysis and fraud prevention to regulatory compliance. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    We&#x2019;re different in one other critically important way. Unlike many organizations in payments and financial services, we built our platform around principles that align PayPal&#x2019;s interests with the interests of those we serve. We succeed when our customers succeed. We grow when we make it easier for people to move and manage money and connect to the things they value. We thrive when we help merchants deepen their knowledge of their customers while respecting their privacy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Money plays such an important role in our everyday lives. It&#x2019;s essential to how people meet their needs, express who they are, and fulfill their dreams. As the disruption and transformation of financial services gains speed, we at PayPal are excited about the limitless opportunities to make money work for people in ways that it never has before.<br><br>Dan Schulman, PayPal President and CEO Designee<br><span style=\"\"></span></div>  <div><div style=\"height: 20px;

The proliferation of mobile devices &#x2013; which have achieved mass adoption faster than any other technology &#x2013; and the digitization of payments are transforming the way money flows across the global financial system. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s not just about making buying and selling more efficient. &#xA0;It&apos;s really about reimagining and rewiring commerce to make retail experiences that help merchants create more personalized offers, provide unparalleled convenience, and deliver ever more security for their customers. &#xA0;And it&#x2019;s about reinventing financial services to make it easier, safer, and more affordable for people to move and manage their money. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">All of this is creating huge disruption in payments and financial services as dozens of companies jostle with one another to recreate some small part of the complex array of systems and services that make digital commerce possible. &#xA0;But here&#x2019;s what we believe &#x2013; no company is in a better position to lead this coming transformation and deliver the benefits that it offers to consumers, merchants, and investors than PayPal. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">Our position is unique. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ve built a comprehensive platform that spans the entire world of digital commerce at a scale that is difficult to match. &#xA0;Our two-sided global digital payments network brings consumers and retailers together in a way that no other company can. &#xA0;Our team is entirely focused on supporting and expanding PayPal&#x2019;s 165 million active accounts. We are committed to our customers&#x2019; trust and privacy. &#xA0;We work every day to make our risk and fraud management technologies, our knowledge of global compliance and financial regulations, our customer service, and our data and analytics capabilities the best in the business. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">All of these assets give us distinct competitive advantages as we pursue a rapidly expanding market. &#xA0;Seventeen years ago, PayPal laid the foundation for e-commerce by making it safe and convenient to send money via email. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ve been driving the expansion of e-commerce ever since, both online and via mobile devices. &#xA0;Together, online and mobile shopping form a $2.5 trillion e-commerce market that is growing at double-digit rates.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">But this only hints at the real size of our opportunity. &#xA0;Ninety percent of retail spending takes place in-person, in a store. &#xA0;With mobile devices becoming more and more central to our everyday activities, mobile experiences can bring online and in-person shopping together into a seamless whole. &#xA0;Already for many people, it is sometimes difficult to see clear lines between online, in app or in store experiences. &#xA0;As we help create this new world in which all commerce is digital commerce, our opportunity will be the entire $25 trillion universe of global retail spending, an addressable market that is 10 times larger than the one we have traditionally targeted. </span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">So we approach the day when we will separate from eBay &#x2013; who will continue to be a key partner &#x2013;with momentum, huge market potential, unmatched assets, and a strong financial foundation. &#xA0;And we look forward with a clear strategy for realizing our opportunities. PayPal will become an essential part of our customers&#x2019; everyday lives by delivering capabilities that enable people around the world to move and manage their money easily, safely, and affordably. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll create an operating system for digital commerce that will make us an essential and comprehensive partner for merchants who seek to deepen engagement with their customers. &#xA0;Our scale will provide the efficiency to reinvest in innovation with the discipline required to continue to revolutionize payments and reinvent commerce. &#xA0;We will continue to provide the very best-in-class in customer service and risk management through our 16,000 employees worldwide.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>  <span style=\"\">This is an exciting time for everyone at PayPal as disruptive technologies create once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to transform how people shop, merchants sell, and everyone manages their finances. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m looking forward to talking to investors this week about our vision for the role that PayPal will play as we continue to pursue our long-standing mission to make it easier for people to use their money to achieve their potential than ever before. </span><br><br><span style=\"\">Dan Schulman, President and CEO-designee, PayPal</span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Since then, we&#x2019;ve enabled millions of people to launch new businesses, handled almost 18 billion transactions, and processed more than $1 trillion in payments. We&#x2019;ve grown to serve 165 million consumers in some 200 countries.

In the second half of 2015 we&#x2019;ll once again be publicly traded on NASDAQ with our original stock ticker symbol PYPL. This is a meaningful symbol for the company because it represents our unbroken commitment to the spirit of the original vision that sparked the launch of PayPal 17 years ago. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    It&#x2019;s been a remarkable journey since then. And today, the potential to make money work better for people has never been greater. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    We&#x2019;re in possibly the greatest period of change and transformation in the history of money and financial services. Everything about how commerce works is in flux &#x2013; how people shop; how merchants sell to consumers; how people interact with financial institutions; the very nature of money itself. Every one of these things is being reimagined on a global scale. No company is in a better position to deliver the benefits of this transformation to consumers and merchants &#x2013; and the resulting value to shareholders &#x2013; than a newly independent, publicly traded PayPal. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    We open this new chapter in PayPal&#x2019;s journey with an unparalleled set of assets and advantages.&#xA0; We are an industry leader in everything from consumer trust and merchant partnerships to risk management, compliance, and customer service, all through a unique two-sided global network that brings consumers and retailers together in a way that no one else can. We have achieved all of this at a worldwide scale that would be difficult for anyone else to replicate. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    Moving forward we intend to create the operating system for a world in which all commerce is digital commerce. We&#x2019;ll become an everyday part of people&#x2019;s lives by continually making it faster, simpler, and safer to manage and move money. We&#x2019;ll deliver capabilities, services, and platforms that are technology and payment agnostic, so that our solutions work the way our customers want and need them to. We&#x2019;ll provide tools that enable developers and innovators to build next generation apps and invent new business models. We&#x2019;ll be the comprehensive solution partner that merchants around the world rely on to thrive as they reach for their own vision of success. <br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>    As we take this step to become an independent company publicly traded under the symbol PYPL once again, we are proud of our history of innovation and success and we are optimistic about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead.

With an incredibility talented team around the world, we&#x2019;re using emerging technologies to constantly innovate while continuing to deliver the secure, reliable global payments network our customers rely on, 24x7.

We&#x2019;ve converted nearly 100 percent of our traffic serving Web/API applications and mid-tier services at PayPal to run on our internal&#xA0;<a href=\"https://stories.paypal-corp.com/home/paypals-front-end-cloud-powered-by-openstack\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">private cloud, based on OpenStack.</a>&#xA0;Our private cloud infrastructure has enabled us to deploy new Java applications and provision infrastructure capacity within minutes instead of days, so we can scale quickly without compromising availability.</li><li style=\"\">Combined Speed and Efficiency:&#xA0;As a result of completely re-architecting our back-end infrastructure, PayPal sped up payment processing by 50 percent in just the past year and reduced the time to push code live to site by more than half.</li><li style=\"\">Robust PaaS:&#xA0;We have fundamentally changed our approach to software development by decoupling the front-end customer experience development from the underlying business capabilities, and built these capabilities into robust service-based platforms. This allows us to quickly iterate on new experiences, customizing our products to individual markets.</li><li style=\"\">Agile Development:&#xA0;We also fundamentally changed our approach to the process of creating new products and experiences by adopting 100 percent Agile. This means our talented team of developers, designers and engineers work side-by-side and push code every few weeks, which enables us to deliver the right products faster, in a rapidly changing environment.</li><li style=\"\">Cutting-edge Technologies:&#xA0;PayPal re-architected a number of our strategic back-end systems and began leveraging open source technology. We piloted Node.js, a platform that lends itself to building fast and highly-scalable network applications.

To combat this myth, merchants should consider offering customers checkout options that do not require the direct exchange of financial information (think, digital wallets).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Smaller businesses can further address customer concerns of online merchant legitimacy by enabling payment after delivery. In some markets, payment service providers that enable pay-after-delivery will even &#x201C;float&#x201D; the transaction for the merchant during the period of delivery. In other words, shoppers won&#x2019;t have to pay for purchases right away, but merchants still get paid immediately. It&#x2019;s a win-win.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Myth 2: Shopping in Stores Is Easier.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Shoppers want instant gratification, so if online shopping doesn&#x2019;t provide convenience or value beyond the in-store experience, many customers won&#x2019;t do it. However,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Together-PayPal-and-Ipsos-Unveil-Top-Growth-Areas-for-Global/ba-p/908613\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">a recent 2014 survey by Ipsos/PayPal</a>&#xA0;found that 43 percent of consumers that shop online do so because it saves them time and money.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>There are a couple of ways merchants can increase the share of consumers that appreciate the value and convenience of buying online. Buy-online-pickup-in-store (aka BOPIS) is a feature that merchants can offer to make purchasing even easier than in-store, while also serving consumer appetite for immediate pick-up.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Free shipping can also fulfill consumer demand for convenience. According to a recent&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2014/6/Study-Consumers-Demand-More-Flexibility-When-Shopping-Online\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">comScore report</a>, free shipping is the most compelling factor for 81 percent of Americans in deciding to finalize online purchases.

In the first 18 months since we first began empowering small businesses in need of capital, PayPal Working Capital has funded an astounding half a billion dollars ($500M) in business loans and we&#x2019;re not stopping there. Giving small business owners even more access to capital, we are now increasing the maximum PayPal Working Capital loan size to up to 15 percent of a merchant&#x2019;s annual PayPal processing volume, or up to $85,000 in the U.S. For merchants in Australia and the UK, maximum merchant cash advance<span style=\"\"> </span>will also increase to $85,000 AUD and &#xA3;50,000 GBP respectively.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br>There are more than 23 million small businesses in the United States that are underserved by traditional banks and still find it challenging to access capital.&#xA0;<span style=\"\">PayPal was founded with small businesses at our core and we are dedicated to helping this community continue to grow.&#xA0;</span>The fact that more than 40,000 businesses globally have now benefitted from PayPal Working Capital, and that PayPal Working Capital is issuing $2 million per day in the U.S. alone, is proof that small businesses are still in need of funding to increase sales volume and grow their business.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Unlike traditional banks and credit cards, PayPal Working Capital loans are funded and dispersed into a merchant&#x2019;s PayPal account within minutes. While approximately half of businesses leverage the loan for inventory, other uses include new product lines, new employees, website improvements, marketing, and managing cash flow.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Approximately 90 percent of borrowers who pay off a PayPal Working Capital loan reapply for a subsequent loan, like Jeff Caruso of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://crisloid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Crisloid</a>,&#xA0;<span style=\"\">maker of handcrafted classic board games.

Those that take it a step further and educate themselves about the ins and outs of payment processing often come out ahead, learning that picking the right partner can have a tangible effect on small business growth. Make sure you are picking a partner that not only meets your needs now, but can also evolve with you.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here are some key considerations to keep in mind:<br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Security comes first.&#xA0;The average data breach today can cost a company&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.databreachcalculator.com/GetStarted.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">$5.5 million</a>with the average cost per compromised record reaching&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.databreachcalculator.com/GetStarted.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">$194</a>. You may or may not be well versed in transaction risk modeling, dual-authentication, or PCI compliance, but your payments partner should be a world-class payments security expert. Small business owners must have peace of mind to concentrate on growing their business, while their payments partner focuses on ensuring secure buying and selling experiences.&#xA0;</li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">One-stop shops are easiest to&#xA0;deal with, but make sure they&#x2019;re willing to partner. Small business owners shouldn&#x2019;t have to deal with three or four different partners in order to accept payments. There are much simpler one-stop-shops, like PayPal, that can take care of processing credit cards, sending online invoices, and other payments options across online, offline and mobile. But look for a partner that supports an &quot;open infrastructure&quot; to accept payments, where you can bring your existing payments partners if you want to. Businesses that have existing payments relationships shouldn&apos;t have to rip out existing systems to sell their products and services in a new channel.</li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Understand actual processing costs &#x2013; not just lowest &#x201C;show rates&#x201D;.&#xA0;Finding a good price seems simple enough &#x2013; until you notice all the asterisks next to the rates you often see. Those asterisks lead to fine print that reveals dramatically higher processing fees on many of the most common types of transactions, including different types of credit or debit cards. Consider working with a processor that offers flat- or blended-rates, charging you one rate for any type of transaction instead of bucketing transactions into various categories.</li></ul><br>Choosing a payment processor for your business is a big decision, so don&#x2019;t act without consideration. Follow these top criteria and the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/7-tips-to-find-the-right-payment-processor\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">other tips outlined in this white paper</a>&#xA0;to make sure you pick a great partner.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>To learn more about how to select a payments processor as a small business, join Dan Leberman, Vice President of PayPal&#x2019;s North American Online Small &amp; Medium Business,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://crisloid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Crisloid</a>&#xA0;(a PayPal merchant), and the U.S. Small Business Administration on Thursday, May 7, at 2:30 p.m. ET for a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://ems.intellor.com/index.cgi?p=205335&amp;t=71&amp;do=register&amp;s=&amp;rID=435&amp;edID=293\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">webinar on how online payments can drive small business growth</a>.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Continue to follow the conversation during our #BizTipsChat Twitter Chat on May 27<span style=\"\">th</span>&#xA0;from 12:00 &#x2013; 1:00pm PT featuring the topic &#x201C;Partnering and Picking a Payments Processor.&#x201D; Throughout the month of May,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paypal4business\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">@PayPal4Business</a>&#xA0;will host Twitter Chats highlighting a new small business topic every Wednesday with the hashtag #BizTipsChat.<br><br>Dan Leberman, Vice President North American Online Small &amp; Medium Business Unit, PayPal<br></div>\n\n\t\t",

The emails sent to Capitol Hill urged Members of Congress to, &#x201C;champion trade policies that ensure small businesses can grow and thrive through the global marketplace&#x201D; and support the modernization of U.S. trade policy.&#xA0; Members of Congress heard from the PayPal and eBay Communities and adopted these pro-small business provisions in both the TPA and the Customs Reauthorization.&#xA0; This is a huge victory for small business traders!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For updates on the trade legislation moving through the U.S. House and Senate, please visit&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ebaymainstreet.com/news/united-states\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">eBay Main Street</a>.&#xA0; To raise your voice in support of small business trade, please visit our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ebaymainstreet.com/campaign/support-small-business-trade\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Action Center</a>.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>To learn more about how small businesses can be successful in selling internationally, join Dan Leberman, Vice President of PayPal&#x2019;s North American Online Small &amp; Medium Business,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://crisloid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Crisloid</a>&#xA0;(a PayPal merchant), and the U.S. Small Business Administration on Thursday, May 7, at 2:30 p.m. ET for a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://ems.intellor.com/index.cgi?p=205335&amp;t=71&amp;do=register&amp;s=&amp;rID=435&amp;edID=293\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">webinar about how online payments can drive small business growth</a><span style=\"\">.</span><br><br><br>Melissa O&#x2019;Malley, Director of Global Merchant &amp; Cross Border Trade Initiatives, PayPal</div>\n\n\t\t",

It&#x2019;s everywhere, all the time, changing how we live, work and play, and will only continue to evolve.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal&#x2019;s employees are critical to keeping up with this dynamic tech environment. What started as a company of three back in 1998 has grown to more than 15,000 employees around the world, with different socioeconomic, cultural, gender, ethnic and educational backgrounds &#x2013; and everybody makes important contributions.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And like many companies, our customers are incredibly diverse as well: they consist of consumers and merchants from 203 different markets in the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. This means there are specific needs they face in their day-to-day buying experiences that require products and services that address those requirements.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>These two points interconnect, because to build solutions for diverse audiences requires diverse thinking. Unfortunately, the tech industry is not the most diverse &#x2013; a fact not lost on our industry. A poignant new documentary,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.codedocumentary.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap</a><span style=\"\">, which premiered&#xA0;</span>at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York last week, explores the realities of diversity in tech and shines a light on the gap that exists for women and minorities in the industry. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, by 2018 there will be 1.4 million open technology jobs in the U.S. and just 61 percent of those openings will be filled, based on the current rate of students graduating with computer science degrees. And of those, only 29 percent of applicants will be women.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Unfortunately, these numbers are real, disheartening and unacceptable. A growing body of research backs the importance of diversity in the workplace.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/Organization/Why_diversity_matters\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">A recent McKinsey study</a>&#xA0;reports that gender-diverse companies are 15 percent more likely to outperform their peers, and the same goes for ethnically-diverse companies, at 35 percent.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That&#x2019;s why at PayPal, we&#x2019;ve put diversity at the forefront. This is particularly important to me, because throughout my career I&#x2019;ve worked alongside some remarkably talented women who have brought next-generation technologies to market. Their passion, energy and skillsets have been a driving force in the industry, and they&#x2019;re completely reimagining and redefining how we innovate every day.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For five years now, the Women&#x2019;s Initiative Network (WIN) at eBay Inc. has helped affect positive change in our organization. Thanks to WIN, we&#x2019;ve more than doubled the number of women in leadership since 2010. And now, nearly half of our workforce &#x2013; 42 percent &#x2013; is female. In my organization at PayPal, we seek out opportunities for women, championing their growth and accomplishments through trainings and mentoring, and by encouraging them to attend external events or hosting our own. We have WIN-related goals to improve our talent pipeline, and we cascade these throughout the organization.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ve also committed to building partnerships that help us make the industry more diverse. For example, we&#x2019;re work with the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University to drive corporate research aimed at improving the evaluation and promotion process for women in tech. And we recently sponsored the first-ever youth and diversity focused hackathon at South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive, which paired high school and college-aged youth with professional mentors to collaborate and build a web or mobile-based app hacking the Education, Health or Justice sectors.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While I am so proud of our efforts to date, these examples just skim the surface of the work to be done. In order for us to provide our customers with the best possible services, we&#x2019;ll need to attract and retain people who help push our organization further by bringing diverse thinking to solving real-world challenges for our customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>There&#x2019;s no doubt that we are still in the early days of making progress, both as a company and as an industry, but I am committed to seeing the diversity challenge through so that we have meaningful, lasting impacts.<br><br>James Barrese, Chief Technology Officer, PayPal<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

Our growth and the new capabilities we are building position us well as we look towards the future.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We delivered 17%* revenue growth in the first quarter, which is a strong foundation to build on as we move into 2015. We continue our steady growth in customer accounts, increasing total active accounts by 3.6 million to 165 million customers across the globe. We expect strong growth to continue in 2015, as we further penetrate the merchant population and build out our products and services to grow more and more relevant to consumers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our customer engagement also steadily increased, with transactions per account growing to 23 in Q1 from 21 in the first quarter of 2014. We processed more than 1 billion transactions in the first quarter. This represents an increase of 24% year over year and importantly our monetization per account accelerated sequentially to $49.

Today PayPal operates in two fast-growing parts of the digital payments industry &#x2013; online and mobile &#x2013; but the online and offline payments worlds are digitizing and converging through mobile experiences. As a result, I believe our addressable market is not just the $2.5 trillion associated with online and mobile, but more like the $25 trillion associated with commerce both online and offline. PayPal has a powerful set of assets, and you can be sure we are not standing still. We are well positioned to take advantage of the changes sweeping through our industry.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>To capitalize on this opportunity, PayPal is in the midst of a massive transformation, completely rebuilding our technology platform, enabling greater scale, faster production cycles, and closer collaboration between teams so we can continuously deliver better products to our customers. PayPal now has one of the largest hybrid clouds in the world, and we have transformed our core business capabilities into robust service-based platforms. PayPal&#x2019;s newly modernized technology platform is becoming a strategic asset.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In revamping our technology and processes, we are dramatically reducing our product development cycles; allowing us to deploy software releases in weeks versus months. Everything we have done in the first six months of my tenure is positioning PayPal to take advantage of what I see as one of the greatest opportunities for growth that the payments industry has ever seen.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We have a lot to execute on, but we now have the right organizational structure, leadership team, and operational discipline to get it done. I am excited about where we are, what we are building, and about PayPal&#x2019;s strong position and potential in this dynamic market.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We have an extraordinary opportunity to redefine the financial lives of millions &#xAD; even billions &#xAD; of people, and by doing so, to truly improve their lives.

Hackers divulged in a Southern cookout with smoked pork shoulders, fish fry, mac and cheese &amp; shrimp and grits.

James Lemieux, Jason Humphries, Brent Piephoff and Magdalyn Duffie of team PairCode built a pair coding app for beginner coders that challenges the players to build a basic front end website through a series of tasks using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Players engage in a back and forth dialog that teaches and promotes pair coding. The app includes links to outside resources for players to do research and purchase challenge hints via PayPal. Inspired by Magdalyn&#x2019;s passion for teaching kids to program, the team decided to build this app to reach a bigger audience of beginner coders. Team PairCode will go on to represent Raleigh at BattleHack World Finals in Silicon Valley this November as they compete against the teams from around the world for the $100,000 grand prize.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Although team PairCode were the clear winners, our judges, Allyson Sutton, Director at HQ Raleigh; Burr Sutton, Product Management Director at Red Hat; Jay Bigelow, Director of Entrepreneurship at Council of Entrepreneurial Development, NC; and Jonathan LeBlanc, Head of Developer Advocacy at Braintree and PayPal, were impressed by all of the teams in Raleigh.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In second place, Team FixMyFolks created a web platform for fixing computers in local communities through charity-driven remote technical support.

So, what have we learned from those on the mobile-cutting-edge?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">1. Ensure your mobile experience is in fact mobile-optimized.</span><br>Don&#x2019;t assume that your desktop website works just as well for mobile viewing. Pick up your phone and see how user-friendly it is.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Google Developers</a>&#xA0;has a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">mobile-friendly test</a>&#xA0;you can take.<span style=\"\">3</span>&#xA0;If needed, look for a developer or third-party platform provider (such as&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">BigCommerce</a>) to help you launch a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/sell-on-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">mobile-responsive experience</a>. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<br><br><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">2. Decide&#xA0;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">how</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">&#xA0;you want to optimize your shopping and checkout experience for mobile.</span><br>There are three ways to help configure your shopping and checkout so that you have the best possible experience for mobile shoppers:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em>Responsive web design</em><br><span style=\"\"></span>Probably the simplest approach, your goal here is to build ONE website (that is, one URL, one set of HTML, etc.) that looks great no matter what device or size screen it&#x2019;s viewed on.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em>Dynamic serving</em><br><span style=\"\"></span>This takes the above one step further by actually serving up TWO sets of code (essentially, two different websites) depending on the viewing device, for an even more targeted experience to mobile shoppers. Your domain name (URL) stays the same.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em>Mobile website</em><br><span style=\"\"></span>Mobile websites use a different domain name (and HTML, etc.) for mobile shoppers. If you&#x2019;ve ever seen a URL like &#x201C;m.domain.com&#x201D;, you&#x2019;re on a mobile site.<br><br><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">3. Don&#x2019;t cut out high perceived-value features.</span><br>It&#x2019;s tough to have a great mobile-optimized experience that has ALL of the functionality of your desktop version. Just remember: mobile shoppers expect to access nearly all of the same features as desktop shoppers, including discount codes and shipping offers.<br><br><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">4. Checkouts need to be as mobile-friendly as the rest of your site.</span><br>One of the most important features of your mobile-friendly site is an easy-to-use checkout process. To help create a mobile-friendly checkout experience:<br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Ensure the &quot;Add to Cart&quot; and &quot;Checkout&quot; buttons, as well as your shopping cart icon, are easy to find.

Last fall, we launched&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">One Touch&#x2122;</a>&#xA0;for native mobile, the industry&apos;s first single touch payment experience on iOS and Android. Since then, we&#x2019;ve seen tremendous results in how much it has improved the buying experience for consumers and merchants alike. So, today we&#x2019;re launching&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnDLl1MtU3w\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">One Touch for Web</a>&#xA0;-- enabling consumers to pay without user IDs and passwords on the Web after their first login, just like we enabled on mobile devices.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Since we launched&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPj8nqNBAbw\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">One Touch</a>&#xA0;for native mobile apps last September, merchants like&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/one-touch-momentum\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Airbnb, Boxed,&#xA0;</a><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/one-touch-momentum\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Jane.com</a><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/one-touch-momentum\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">, Lyft</a><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/one-touch-momentum\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">,&#xA0;</a><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/one-touch-momentum\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Munchery</a><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/one-touch-momentum\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">, YPlan</a>&#xA0;and many others have enabled their customers to checkout with PayPal in a single touch. Not only did consumers love the experience, but we heard from many of our merchants that One Touch led to an immediate increase in sales, average order values, customer adoption and loyalty. For example, Yplan reported a double digit increase in conversions since using One Touch, and StubHub reported a double digit increase in total sales and transactions through PayPal on iOS with One Touch since enabling One Touch for mobile last fall. And because One Touch enables consumers to pay without entering any payment information even at signup, it helps to increase customer adoption.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With the extension of One Touch for mobile and web browsers, merchants can now offer their customers this same great buying experience across the Web, enabling more seamless and secure shopping. Most PayPal merchants will automatically have One Touch enabled for their customers, without needing to do any integration. Consumers that choose to pay via One Touch will soon be able to securely checkout across millions of PayPal enabled websites in a single touch, without having to re-enter their login information. And since we&#x2019;ve extended the product beyond native mobile, One Touch will soon be available to PayPal&#x2019;s 165M customer accounts regardless of whether they have the PayPal mobile app.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>You&#x2019;ll start seeing these consumer experiences roll out in many of your favorite PayPal merchant checkout experiences today beginning in the US, and expanding internationally in the coming months.<br><br>Bill Ready, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Merchant and Next-Generation Commerce, PayPal<br><br></div>  <div>  <!--BLOG_SUMMARY_END--></div>  <div><div class=\"wsite-multicol\"><div class=\"wsite-multicol-table-wrap\" style=\"margin:0 -15px;\"> \t<table class=\"wsite-multicol-table\"> \t\t<tbody class=\"wsite-multicol-tbody\"> \t\t\t<tr class=\"wsite-multicol-tr\"> \t\t\t\t<td class=\"wsite-multicol-col\" style=\"width:25.797666402897%; padding:0 15px;\"> \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"wsite-spacer\" style=\"height:50px;\"></div>   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</td>\t\t\t\t<td class=\"wsite-multicol-col\" style=\"width:48.935779568383%; padding:0 15px;\"> \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"wsite-youtube\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;\"><div class=\"wsite-youtube-wrapper wsite-youtube-size-auto wsite-youtube-align-center\"> <div class=\"wsite-youtube-container\">  <iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qnDLl1MtU3w?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></div>   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</td>\t\t\t\t<td class=\"wsite-multicol-col\" style=\"width:25.26655402872%; padding:0 15px;\"> \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"wsite-spacer\" style=\"height:50px;\"></div>   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</td>\t\t\t</tr> \t\t</tbody> \t</table> </div></div></div>  \n\n\t\t",

With this combination, she&#x2019;ll play a central role in helping us reach our ambitious goals for growth without ever losing sight of the regulatory and legal obligations our customers trust us to uphold, or the values we share with them. </span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\">Jonathan brings strong business insights and deep international leadership experience to his new role as Senior Vice President of </span><span \"font-size:11.0pt;=\"\" mso-ascii-font-family:calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:calibri\"=\"\" style=\"\">Strategy and Growth.

For every item sold, 10 trees are planted in areas where they can influence a greater transformation. So far, tentree has planted about 4.9 million trees in countries such as Madagascar, Senegal, Cambodia, Nepal and Canada.

They live by the motto:&#xA0;<em style=\"\">protect the world you play in</em>. It was clear to the founders that there was a gap between socially-minded companies and environmentally-minded companies. Many clothing manufacturers aim to reduce the impact they have on the environment, but only a select few genuinely make a difference. That&#x2019;s when tentree set out to break the mold.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The founders started by selling a test order of 100 T-shirts to friends and family late in 2011. Selling hundreds of shirts at a time, their story spread as their brand&#x2019;s popularity grew. To meet growing demand and to reach people outside of their hometown of Regina, Saskatchewan, the founders enlisted the help of their cousin (and co-founder) Stephen to lead the e-commerce side of the business. Under his direction, tentree built an online store with PayPal as their exclusive payment partner. The tentree team chose PayPal because it meant that in just a few clicks, they could start accepting money, moving them closer to their tree planting goals. A year later, the team completed their first major plant in Madagascar.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Due to extreme poverty in Madagascar, locals cut down forests to use the wood for fuel and construction materials, or to clear land for agriculture. This deforestation deprived the soil of its fertility and strength, leaving villagers without land suitable for growing food and generating income. Through tentree&#x2019;s efforts &#x2013;&#xA0;<strong>2,819,700 trees have been planted in Madagascar</strong>. The variety of trees planted has helped revitalize the coastline and offered a sustainable agriculture industry for the local residents. Many can now afford to pay for healthier food, decent clothes, and healthcare.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>In 2012 the tentree team was able to plant again, this time in Senegal. For this plant tentree joined forces with Trees for the Future,a Senegal-based group. Before their arrival, locals found employment working as peanut farmers &#x2013; most making less than $200 USD a year. Tentree and Trees for the Future saw an opportunity to improve the social and ecological status of the region. They provided locals with vegetable and fruit tree seeds and taught them how to turn unsustainable crops into profitable farms. A year after the Senegal plant, tentree founder and CEO Derrick Emsley returned to find a transformed landscape. On a visit to a farmer&#x2019;s home to discuss the progress, Derrick remembers one particularly touching moment where a little boy offered him a piece of fruit picked from a type of tree planted by tentree.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br>Over the past four years, the tentree team has grown and their online store has evolved. Now, they are using&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">PayPal Payments Pro</a>&#xA0;to power their business. In the years to come, tentree wants to see their message and efforts stretch well beyond Canada, both in the apparel they sell and the environmental impact they make.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;We want to be viewed as the premier environmental brand on the planet. We have high hopes for where we can take things and the impact we can have.&#x201D; &#x2013; Derrick Emsley, CEO, tentree<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Chris Morse, Head of Merchant Communications, PayPal<br><span style=\"\"></span></div> <hr style=\"width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;\">  <div><div class=\"wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin \" style=\"padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center\"> <a> <img src=\"/uploads/4/8/9/8/48984695/9531370_orig.jpg\" alt=\"Picture\" style=\"width:auto;max-width:100%\"> </a> <div style=\"display:block;font-size:90%\"></div> </div></div>\n\n\t\t",

New research findings from PayPal* show that the strong dollar is having an impact on Americans&#x2019; travel plans, though more could be taking advantage of the golden opportunity.

Where to start? PayPal has some quick tips on how to tidy up everything from passwords and email to finances and photos.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">One Password to Rule Them All</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>Take a minute to think about where you store your passwords to your favorite online sites. Are they listed in a file on your desktop? Written in a pocket-sized notebook or on various sticky notes in your office? Now, consider the strength of your passwords and whether or not you use the same phrase, pet name or series of numbers for everything. If you answered yes to any of these questions, you are a perfect target for any hacker. The easiest solution is to sign-up for a password manager like LastPass, Dashlane, or 1Password. These services and apps will not only store all of your log-in credentials in one safe place, but also help you generate and strengthen passwords, plus much more. It&#x2019;s time to shred your precious password notebook.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The Road to Inbox Zen</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>You have 1,257 unread emails and don&#x2019;t even know how you got on an Alaskan cruise ship email list. Do you ever wish that your inbox number was zero or that you could cut back on the number of newsletters and shopping emails you receive? A few simple tricks that can get you on the road to inbox zen include: 1) deleting emails that you don&#x2019;t need to keep, 2) Unsubscribing from daily or weekly newsletters or social network notifications 3) creating a filing system or setting up an auto-sort filter according to a email topic so that you can easily find messages when you need them.<br><br><strong style=\"\">Make Your Money Work Better For You</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>With tax season still fresh in your mind, you probably have a decent snapshot of how much you made, spent and saved last year. If you haven&#x2019;t already, this is the perfect time to sit down and map out your financial goals for the rest of 2015. Start by developing a budget and tracking it manually or with an online tool like Mint.com. Take care of any &#x201C;IOU&#x2019;s&#x201D; to friends or family with PayPal or Venmo. Make sure your online automatic payments are still up-to-date and activate paperless statements to &#x201C;go green.&#x201D; Other areas that need maintenance at least once a year are your savings, investment and retirement accounts.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Get Control of Your Digital Photo Collection</strong><br>Between your digital camera, mobile phone, laptop and social networks, it can be very difficult to keep track of your personal photos and videos. To get organized, many photo experts recommend utilizing a cloud service like Dropbox or iPhoto or signing up for a photo-hosting site such as Shutterfly. The idea behind using these services is to safely consolidate and back up your precious memories so that you don&#x2019;t lose them if your phone gets stolen or computer stops working. Some added bonuses of these services include nearly unlimited storage of high-resolution images and videos, and the ability to easily turn your photos into prints and albums that can be delivered to your doorstep.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\">Carey Kolaja, VP Head of Global Consumer Products, PayPal</span><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

With mobile phones and the abundance of apps, paper is becoming obsolete.

We began routing 20 percent of our workloads through our private cloud, giving us more flexibility and agility. Since, we have continued to build on top a broad base of OpenStack technologies. With our private cloud infrastructure, we&#x2019;ve been able to deploy new Java applications and provision infrastructure capacity within minutes - instead of days. It is critical that we have infrastructure that is available on demand for our developers to deploy to. At the same time, it is important we have highly available infrastructure that is consistently manageable at scale.<br><br>In leveraging open source technology, it&#x2019;s important that we engage with the community. We&#x2019;re doing so as an active contributor to several OpenStack projects. We&#x2019;re committed to open source technologies because we benefit from the collective innovation of the community (others who are just as passionate as us) and we contribute back via our findings at scale and best practices though generations of upgrades.<br><br>A big thanks to our talented cloud team that is using cutting-edge technologies to build the next generation of PayPal&#x2019;s global infrastructure and payment platforms.

In her panel session with Owen Thomas of ReadWrite, our own Carey Kolaja discussed the new payment experience through wearable devices and how it&#x2019;s shifting the way consumers want to pay how, when and where they want to make their lives easier, providing them with greater flexibility and convenience.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong>What&#x2019;s Next?</strong>&#xA0;Wearable payments aren&#x2019;t a replacement for the mobile wallet, but an extension.

With new technology like the Apple Watch and Fitbit, today&#x2019;s world consists of an eco-system of different devices, which are further connecting our digital and physical worlds and bridging the gap between online and offline shopping experiences. This is also generating discussion around the role identity plays in our digital existence with the introduction of finger print authentication. At SXSW, for example,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/abothman/status/576930107090063360\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">we got to check out a new technique</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; electromyography (EMG) &#x2013; it evaluates and records electric activity produced by skeletal muscles, which enables others to control body gestures or movements in another human.

The last thing people want to think about before a vacation is money, but as many seasoned travelers know, it&#x2019;s important to think about Spring Break spending strategies in advance so it doesn&#x2019;t cross your mind later, when you should be relaxing and taking in the sights.<br><br><strong><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1428517653722_5341110958252102\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\">&#xFEFF;</span>Security</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>Many services, vacation rentals and tour companies require visitors to book in advance and put a deposit down before arriving. When completing a foreign transaction with an unfamiliar merchant, use a payment system like PayPal to help keep your money secure.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/security/buyer-protection\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">PayPal&#x2019;s Purchase Protection&#xA0;</a>covers all eligible online purchases, whether it&#x2019;s a wine country tour in Tuscany or a train ticket from Berlin to Munich. All transactions are monitored around the clock and protected by next-level encryption to ensure your money gets to the right place. Paying with your mobile wallet also means you can avoid carrying big bills, theft, losing money in bags or leaving it back at the hotel. PayPal also converts currencies for purchases and accepts 26 different currencies around the world. Making it easy to shop overseas.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong>Spending &amp; Saving</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>According to Airlines Reporting Corporation, the best day to purchase airfare is Sunday, when prices are lowered to fill seats for the upcoming week&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/forums/postpage/board-id/PPFWD#_edn1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a>. It&#x2019;s also important to take advantage of early travel deals and book vacations well in advance to access more affordable rates. Package deals and all-inclusive trips have pre-negotiated prices and discounts, which allows vacationers to get more bang for their buck. Also, consider whom you&#x2019;re traveling with - if there are kids or seniors in the group, take advantage of discounts at theme parks, movie theaters or restaurants.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>If money is tight, rethink the 5-star hotel or 4-course meals. Remind yourself that it&#x2019;s all about the memories, not the accommodations. Consider staying at a more moderately priced hotel, renting from Airbnb or doing a house swap. To avoid spending a fortune on food, consider keeping breakfast foods, snacks and picnic supplies at your hotel or house, then also make sure to ask a local about their favorite dive spot. Spottedbylocals or PayPal Deals can also help you find the best grub nearby.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong>Sharing</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>There&#x2019;s nothing worse than attempting to split a hotel or restaurant bill ten different ways. Whether traveling with college friends or family members, anyone can take advantage of mobile payments for seamless spending and sharing. Apps like Venmo and PayPal make personal transfers easy and painless through a simple swipe on your smartphone. There are even options to bill friends directly or remind them to pay you back, so you can avoid awkward conversations or keeping track of I.O.Us.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/forums/postpage/board-id/PPFWD#_ednref1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">[1]</span></span></a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-day-to-buy-airline-tickets-1413999377\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">&quot;The Best Day to Buy Airline Tickets&quot;</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; Wall Street Journal (2014, October 22)<span id=\"selectionBoundary_1428517653722_7825507407542318\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\">&#xFEFF;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br>Melissa O&#x2019;Malley, Director of Global Merchant and Cross Border Trade Initiatives, PayPal<br></div>\n\n\t\t",

A little known fact is that Guinness originally started brewing ale, not its famous stout. It wasn&#x2019;t until many years after Arthur&#x2019;s death in 1803 that his son, Arthur Guinness II, created the company&#x2019;s iconic modern stout beer in 1821.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/forums/postpage/board-id/PPFWD#_edn1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">[i]</span></span></a><br><br><strong style=\"\">Color Photography</strong><br>From film to digital to Instagram, photography has come a long way.

From 2013-2016, the multi-country average compound annual growth rate for mobile commerce is projected at 42 percent vs.13 percent for overall ecommerce (including mobile commerce). The research, which investigated the mobile shopping habits of more than 17,500 consumers in 22 countries, also reveals insights on mobile shopping behavior, barriers and growth markets.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;We are on the cusp of the mobile-first era,&#x201D; said Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiatives for PayPal. &#x201C;At PayPal we&#x2019;ve seen our mobile growth rise from less than one percent of our payment volume in 2010 to more than 20 percent in 2014.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">A Bright Future for Mobile Commerce</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>As a percentage of global** online spend, mobile commerce is still relatively small: according to the research, smartphone purchases are driving nine percent of online spend and purchases made on tablets account for only five percent of online spend. However, both are dwarfed by laptops, desktops and notebooks, which cumulatively are used for 85 percent of online spend.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While spend numbers might be low; the prevalence of mobile shopping is quite significant. A third (33 percent) of online shoppers surveyed report having purchased something via smartphone in the past 12 months, and 20 percent report making a purchase via tablet. The surge in smartphone commerce is being driven by young adults. A global average of 59% of smartphone shoppers are between 18-34 years old vs. 44 percent of total online shoppers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">China, Turkey, United Arab Emirates Dominate Smartphone Shopping</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates dominate in smartphone commerce. Emirati online shoppers attribute on average 24 percent of their online spend to smartphone purchases, Chinese consumers follow closely behind at 21 percent and Turks come in third at 19 percent. The three also lead in smartphone-shopping density. In China, more than two thirds (68 percent) of online shoppers have used a smartphone to make a purchase in the last 12 months. More than half (57 percent and 53 percent respectively) of Emirati and Turks have done so.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Online Consumers Opt for Apps</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>Globally, 64 percent of smartphone shoppers have purchased via an app and 52 percent have purchased via browser. Among those who have used both platforms, apps are typically preferred (47% prefer to shop through an app). When all smartphone and tablet users were asked about the benefits of using an App to pay for things either online or offline, the most cited benefits were convenience (35% of smartphone/tablet users agree this is a benefit) and speed (30%).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Other unique perceived benefits of using apps by country include: &#x201C;instant confirmation of payment&#x201D; in Mexico (selected by 37% of Mexican smartphone/tablet users); &#x201C;having a reminder to apply offers/discounts/coupons&#x201D; in China (30%); and &#x201C;keeping track of digital receipts&#x201D; in Israel (26%).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Product Research Today; Nascent Features Tomorrow</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>Currently, the most cited m-commerce related activity among smartphone owners or users is product research: 36% said they had &#x201C;searched for product information on my smartphone&#x201D; in the past 12 months, 27% had &#x201C;used my smartphone to help locate/find information about a store or business&#x201D; and 25% had &#x201C;read customer or user reviews from my smartphone.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>However, when smartphone users were asked how they&#x2019;d like to use their smartphones in the future (out of the things they haven&#x2019;t already done), the top responses related to nascent features including payment options. Sixteen percent of smartphone users selected &#x201C;tap my smartphone at the cash register to pay (e.g. using NFC)&#x201D; and 15 percent cited &#x201C;ordered ahead (e.g. coffee or food) using an app or browser on my smartphone.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Barriers to Mobile Commerce</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>The biggest barrier to faster mobile commerce growth is that consumers don&#x2019;t yet perceive the advantages over shopping on devices with larger screens.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Among smartphone owners/users who have not used their smartphones to shop in the past 12 months, the top stated barriers are: &#x201C;prefer to purchase online from other devices (e.g. laptop, desktop)&#x201D; (selected by 39 percent), &#x201C;the screen size is too small&#x201D; (34 percent), and &#x201C;prefer to access the Internet via other devices&#x201D; (28 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Those who have shopped via smartphone in the past 12 months state slightly different reasons for not doing so more often: &#x201C;the screen size is too small&#x201D; (stated by 34 percent), &#x201C;prefer to purchase online from other devices (e.g. laptop, desktop)&#x201D; (27 percent), and &#x201C;concern about security of online purchases made from a mobile device&#x201D; (21 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;With the advent of low cost mobile phones, larger phone screen sizes and mobile device security improvements, the barriers to mobile commerce will decrease,&#x201D; continued Nayar. &#x201C;Those improvements, combined with streamlined digital payment options like<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/One-Touch-Payments-With-PayPal-Coming-Soon-to-An-App-Near-You/ba-p/860289\" style=\"\" title=\"\">&#xA0;PayPal OneTouch&#x2122;</a>&#xA0;will make it easier, more secure and more intuitive for customers to pay with their mobile phone.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>*On Behalf of PayPal, Ipsos interviewed a representative quota sample of c.800 (17,519 in total) adults (aged 18 or over) who own and/or use an internet enabled device* in each of 22 countries (UK, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Turkey, Russia, Israel, UAE, USA, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, China, Australia).

In fact, 83 percent of online Austrian consumers shop cross-border, followed by Israel (82 percent) and Australia (75 percent). What&#x2019;s more, Austrians are poised to increase their international purchases in 2015.</span><br><br>Why should this matter to SMBs around the world? Cross-border trade can be a vital source of incremental revenue for them &#x2013; and by expanding into the global marketplace, these businesses can reach new customers, tap into new holidays beyond their own seasonal sales cycles, and ultimately grow their bottom line. When choosing where to market their goods, business owners shouldn&#x2019;t just look at the size of a country, but the willingness of its shoppers to go online and purchase goods internationally.<br><br>Ready to sell to eager cross-border shoppers in Austria? To find lasting success, merchants would do well to follow these top tips:<br><br><strong>1. Appetite for Apparel</strong><br>Companies selling clothing, handbags, shoes and other apparel items have the biggest opportunity to increase their sales in Austria, as those are their most frequent cross-border purchases. According to a recent report from Euromonitor, Austria&#x2019;s annual spending per capita on clothing reached &#x20AC;959 in 2013; footwear &#x20AC;207. Leisurewear &#x2013; sneakers, rain jackets, fleeces, and jogging trousers, as well as outdoor brands &#x2013; are quite popular with Austrian shoppers, even among urban dwellers who don&#x2019;t take part in much sporting activity.<br><br>As awareness of sustainability issues has increased in Austria, so have its shoppers&#x2019; appetites for &#x201C;green&#x201D; fashion. Low-impact items that are produced without chemicals, animal products and using organic materials, are increasingly sought after.<br><br>Other popular cross-border purchase items in Austria include entertainment goods, educational products and toys from other countries.<br><br><strong style=\"\">2. Pay Attention to Buying Behavior</strong><br>To successfully market to Austrian cross-border consumers, certain shopping behaviors and purchasing motivators should be considered:<br><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Contain shipping costs: Austrian consumers are largely driven by shipping costs. More than half (59%) of those who shop cross-border, and 59% of those who do not, cite delivery shipping costs as something that prevents them from purchasing from international websites. Similarly, 52% of Austrian online shoppers say that free shipping would make them more likely to purchase from an international site.</li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Optimize for mobile: Austrian mobile commerce spend is booming: in 2013, total spend reached just over US $1 billion; between 2013 and 2016, that number is predicted to grow by 205 percent. Mobile apps are becoming the preferred way Austrians shop online. Among Austrian consumers who have purchased via both an app and a browser, apps are preferred by 43 percent of smartphone shoppers and 40 percent of tablet shoppers. Additionally, Austrians are increasingly shopping on the go &#x2013; 35 percent purchased and 36 percent searched for product info on their phone or tablet in the last year.</li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Value their money and time: The two top factors that drive Austrians&#x2019; cross-border purchases are savings (43 percent) and convenience (38 percent). To increase the chances of a sale, merchants should clearly merchandize clearance items and ensure simple, seamless navigation to minimize shopping cart abandonment.<br><br></li></ul><strong style=\"\">3. Tap into Top Holidays</strong><br>Many western merchants will find it easy to tap into Austria&#x2019;s top holidays, as they are largely the same: Christmas, Easter and Halloween are some of Austria&#x2019;s top gift-giving occasions.<br><br>Christmas is Austria&#x2019;s most celebrated tradition &#x2013; and by far its largest gift-giving event. As with many other countries that celebrate the holiday, Austrians&#x2019; biggest online shopping day is during the Christmas season: in 2014, according to Adobe Digital Index, holiday ecommerce sales were expected to peak at $91 million on December 8th. In fact, Austria rivals the US and Brazil for the largest share of annual online sales during the holiday period.<br><br>Easter is another popular holiday in Austria, with three-quarters of children receiving small gifts. Halloween is also gaining popularity in Austria, with spending increasing on sweets, costumes and pumpkins.<br><br><strong style=\"\">Ready, Set, SELL!</strong><br>It&#x2019;s clear that Austria presents a huge opportunity for SMBs searching for new ways to increase their online global sales. Armed with this these key insights into Austrians&#x2019; shopping behaviors, purchasing trends and key sales dates, merchants can feel empowered to sell to them with confidence.<br><br>&#xA0;What&#x2019;s holding you back from finding at least one new customer in Austria today?<br><br>Melissa O&#x2019;Malley, Director, Global Merchant and Cross Border Trade Initiatives, PayPal<br></div>\n\n\t\t",
