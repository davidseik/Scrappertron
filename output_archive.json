Product is the heartbeat of PayPal, so it was imperative that we found the best fit to run this team so we can keep innovating at scale.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We looked at both internal and external candidates and I&#x2019;m thrilled to announce we&#x2019;ve found the ideal candidate within our own PayPal family. Hill Ferguson, who currently heads up our Mobile team, will now assume leadership of the Global Product team.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&#x2019;ve known Hill for a long time, having worked together at Zong and most recently as leaders of the PayPal Mobile team. Hill is obsessed with consumer and merchant experiences, and he&#x2019;s the kind of guy who loses sleep when we put our customers through bad experiences. Hill has a strong track record of delivering: the ability to develop and drive a global product vision; a deep knowledge and understanding of the customer experience; an entrepreneurial spirit; an innate capability to cut through the clutter and simplify things; and finally an extensive experience in payments and financial services products.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Hill&#x2019;s career achievements are impressive, having led product teams at Yahoo! around several of their flagship products including Yahoo! Finance. He then served as GM for Yodlee, where he developed a slew of new products that quadrupled the company&#x2019;s revenue; founded LoanBack, which has processed over $1.5B in &#x201C;friends and family&#x201D; loans; co-founded Moneycard Financial, an innovative financial services company serving the underbanked; before joining me at Zong to invent the most frictionless mobile payment experience in over 50 countries. More recently, as the head of PayPal&#x2019;s Mobile product team, he led our efforts around PayPal Here and, subsequently, the Mobile Check In API.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At PayPal we truly feel that we have an enormous opportunity to change the world and create the future of money, and we can&#x2019;t wait to deliver the next installments of that vision.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

In fact, in 2011, we helped over 200,000 charitable organizations receive more than $3 billion through PayPal, and the eBay community raised an additional $63 million through eBay Inc. giving programs.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I know you&#x2019;ll be inspired when you read about all of this year&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.stayclassy.org/classy-awards/regional-winners\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">CLASSY Award winners</a>.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Nov 19<br><strong style=\"\">Anuj Nayar, Senior Director of Global Initiatives, PayPal</strong><br><br>Thanksgiving week has started and while the traditional belief is that holiday shopping really kicks into high gear this week, we have compelling data that tells us the official U.S. shopping season actually started on September 30th!!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal processes nearly one-fifth of global ecommerce and our data builds on recent industry findings. The National Retail Federation said 41.4 percent of Americans said they would start shopping before Halloween and more than half have started by now.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This is yet another illustration of what we all see every time we go to the mall or a store. Holiday shopping gets earlier and earlier every year but that&#x2019;s just part of a much bigger trend. Technology has fundamentally changed the retail shopping calendar. Retailers are now offering &#x201C;holiday&#x201D; deals as the fall leaves are just starting to turn. Consumers are still hungry to snap up the best offers available but they&#x2019;re now shopping from the global marketplace, not just the stores down the street&#x2026;and they&#x2019;re doing it in new and different ways.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Last year, we told you about a growing trend called &#x201C;couch commerce.&#x201D; We predicted that on Thanksgiving Day 2011, we would see a big spike of people going from the dinner table to the couch to start their shopping from their mobile device &#x2013; tablet or smartphone. And that&#x2019;s exactly what we saw. On Thanksgiving Day 2011, we saw a 511 percent increase in mobile purchases over Thanksgiving Day 2010. That&#x2019;s huge! Let me be clear, this is JUST from mobile devices. It makes sense, while you wouldn&#x2019;t start shopping from your laptop or PC at the dinner table, you can from a tablet or mobile device as the tryptophan is kicking in and you no longer want to chat with weird relatives who have come over for the day.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A new survey from PayPal and comScore shows 62 percent of people said they&#x2019;ll use their mobile device for holiday shopping, whether that&#x2019;s to get price comparisons, product information or actually make a purchase. These are devices that were not around at the last election and now almost two thirds of shoppers are using them to drive their purchase decisions! The infographic below captures this new PayPal data and even more stats that illustrate the incredible impact technology is having on holiday shopping this year.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>But whether you are shopping from a mobile device, a computer or in-store, you still want to make sure you are getting the best deal so PayPal is offering price matching for all your holiday purchases. This is very different from the price matching you see from some big box retailers this season. We will match the price whether you see the lower one online or in a store (and we are even price matching for airline tickets). And you get to price match for 30 days after your purchase, not just when you&#x2019;re in the store at checkout. We&#x2019;re also offering complimentary return shipping for your online purchases and the ability to buy now and pay up to six months later.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I hope you get a chance to take advantage of these great benefits this holiday season and experience the ability to purchase anytime, anywhere, any way. If you started shopping for the holidays as the fall leaves just started to turn, please tell us why (and what you were shopping for) in the comments!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Dec 07<br><strong style=\"\">Carey Kolaja, Vice President, Global Product Solutions, PayPal</strong><br><br><span style=\"\">In my desk drawer&#xA0;is a plastic bag where I store all of my &#x201C;non-daily use cards&#x201D; that I don&#x2019;t want&#xA0;to throw out. I trust that we all have this collection, but let&#x2019;s face it, I never use it&#x2026;So what is the value on them?&#xA0; As I took all of my cards out the other day (the picture below is my own) I found myself wondering, how do I pool them together to increase the purchasing power for something I actually want, need, care about?</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That&#x2019;s when I decided to use my cards towards my holiday shopping, &#xA0;I called it my &#x201C;gift card + card&#x201D; challenge. With 15 separate cards, I spent hours trying to sort out the amount of funding I had left on each card. However, after spending a good amount of time entering in gift card numbers, I received &#x201C;error denied&#x201D; message after message as my cards expired months ago. This experience left me dissatisfied and frustrated over the waste of money I saw sitting before me.&#xA0;I sat there wondering if it is worth it to constantly be aware of when my cards will expire or just abandon the value on them all together.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I figure there has to be an easier way than having&#xA0;physical bits of plastic that I have to keep track of and find a reason to spend at that specific merchant. The reality is with little time to get everything done these days,&#xA0;the value on the cards will most likely&#xA0;expire before I get around to using them. And I know I&#x2019;m not alone in my frustration on this. In fact, billions of dollars&#x2019; worth of cards go unused each year. At any given time, there&#x2019;s $30 to $40 billion in unused gift card value lying dormant.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At PayPal, we&#x2019;re all about finding ways to solve customer frustrations with their money and help consumers be smarter with their spending. With partnerships like&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.plasticjungle.com/exchange/paypal\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Plastic Jungle</a>, we can offer our customers more choices when it comes to holiday spending. At the end of the day, turning hidden pools of value into purchasing power is easy. So round up those gift cards, select from hundreds of merchants using Plastic Jungle to cash in cards (need minimum of $25 on them). You can get up 92% of the value delivered directly to your PayPal account to pay for purchases on your favorite sites. (Payout varies. See details on Plastic Jungle website*)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And consumers should have multiple ways to turn abandoned value into useable funds. In the not-so-far-off future, those piles of unused gift cards won&#x2019;t exist. As we go through our shopping we won&#x2019;t have to think about tracking loyalty points and making sure our discounts are applied &#x2013; because our digital wallets will be doing the work for us. And that&#x2019;s what my team is set on making a reality. Shopping, after all, is meant to be fun.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

And the good news is that you can now shop around the clock in De 9 Straatjes! In fact, it is Europe&#x2019;s first shopping area where you can shop in 30 exclusive boutiques, 24 hours a day from your mobile phone.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">How does it work?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>All participating shops have affixed QR codes to their shop window.

Mobile is fast becoming the navigation system for our lives and smartphone adoption in The Netherlands is currently at 44% (well above the European average of 30%).* We expect, given the mobile phone replacement rate of today, that it is likely to exceed 75% within the next two years. A recent study we conducted amongst Dutch consumers shows that people in the age-bracket 18-34 would rather leave home without their wallet than forget their smart phone.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That light smartphone in your pocket has got more processing power than the big desktop PC you had in your study room eight years ago.

CEO, has said that the way consumers shop and pay in the next 3 years will change more than it has in the last 20. In The Netherlands, we see that prediction already coming true. The next wave will be a dramatic blurring of the lines between e-Commerce, m-Commerce and high street retail. Physical retailers will use internet technology to make consumers&#x2019; lives easier in several different ways: skipping the line, order remote and pick up in store, location based shopping assistance, or opt-in, user profile based service and incentives.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While we are very proud of the QRoute model in De 9 Straatjes zone, this is not an end station. We see this as a first step into that convergent world for PayPal in The Netherlands. 2012 is a test and learn year for all of us at PayPal around the world. We are testing many new ways for customers to shop anywhere they want. With this project we&#x2019;re learning more about how to maximize the fantastic real estate available in shop windows to help sales 24&#xD7;7.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And as Amsterdam is the second best city to visit in 2013 by Lonely Planet, I recommend you check out the QRoute if you are visiting any time soon.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#x201C;Tot ziens&#x201D; in Amsterdam!</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">*Source: Mobile First research by TNS, 2012</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

The real opportunity for technology is to solve deep customer needs in new ways. That&#x2019;s what PayPal did 14 years ago when it allowed all of us to purchase items quickly and easily online.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With that in mind, I wanted to share some thought starters, perhaps predictions, for 2013:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1. NFC will fail to gain mass adoption</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The NFC payments debate will slowly die in 2013. Is tapping a phone on a terminal any easier than swiping a credit card? I don&#x2019;t think so &#x2013; it&#x2019;s not solving a real consumer problem and its not providing additional value to encourage me (or anyone else for that matter) to change my behavior.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. The payments, loyalty and coupons businesses will merge</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The digital wallet must offer more than another way to pay. It needs to remove complexity from your life, not increase it. For sure, the technology needs to be great, and simple, but then it should get out of your way and let you focus on the things you most want &#x2013; loyalty points or rewards for example. In 2013 payments will finally merge with loyalty and rewards. These three separate businesses will converge to make it easy for consumers and merchants to automatically leverage appropriate coupons and offers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. The cash register will go mobile</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the old retail model, customers browsed in the aisle and paid at the register. This was partly because the registers were hard-wired to phone lines to gain the necessary authorizations. As we move to a world where even the transactions in a shop are transmitted on the back end via the Internet, sales associates will be free to roam the stores and help their customers check out and pay from the aisle or even the changing room&#x2026; and if they don&#x2019;t have the right size or color in stock, they&#x2019;ll order it for you on the spot to be delivered direct to your home.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">4. The rise of new experiences beyond check in</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>To me, new location-based experiences will revolutionize more than just shopping. The power to be fed just what you want, when you want it, was still a science fiction fantasy in 2011. It is only just now coming to light in 2012 in its most basic form with solutions like Apple&#x2019;s Passbook. I think that location aware, and context-relevant shopping and payments experiences will be one of those technologies that changes much much more for the consumer than even the hard working technologists in Silicon Valley can imagine today.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>2013 will be the year that we will truly see disruption in the shopping and payments space, and here at PayPal we are looking forward to playing an integral role by solving real problems for people, merchants, developers and advertisers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

It&#x2019;s a great example of our renewed focus on creating beautiful and easy-to-use products that are tailored to address our customers&#x2019; specific needs. In this case, for small businesses to finally offer their customers an easy to use alternative to cash.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>This game-changing product reflects the huge amount of time we spent talking and listening to small businesses. They are the core of PayPal&#x2019;s business and they&#x2019;ve told us that they want a simple, secure way to take card payments anytime and anywhere they trade. We&#x2019;ve used that feedback to create what we think is the best payment device ever created. It&#x2019;s a great example of our vision for PayPal: a wonderful customer experience from the moment the PayPal Here app is downloaded to taking the device out of the box and accepting a first payment. We&#x2019;ve even included a &#x2018;click to call us&#x2019; button in the app so our customer service team can be reached in one click just in case help is needed.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here&#x2019;s a video on how it works.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>You download the PayPal Here app, and sign up for the device right there. There&#x2019;s no contract or on-going fees, just the initial competitive purchase price and a small fee for each transaction. (We&#x2019;ll announce actual pricing a little closer to the launch.) You pair the device with your Android phone or iPhone to accept secure payments anytime, anywhere you trade, whether at a market stall, shop, restaurants, taxi or even in your customer&#x2019;s home. Just like its original counterpart in the US and other countries, it allows you to send invoices &amp; receipts wherever you do business, as well as taking card and of course PayPal payments.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We are launching the Chip &amp; PIN version of PayPal Here in the UK first.

This week, PayPal, along with Lenovo, Nok Nok Labs, Validity and others, announced the formation of the FIDO Alliance (Fast Identity Online) to revolutionize online authentication for Internet users everywhere.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Why Now?</span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Authentication is unmanageable for users.</span>&#xA0;Users have too many Internet accounts and cannot manage unique passwords for each. The industry statistics show that many people simply reuse the same password everywhere and most of the rest have only three or four passwords that are reused everywhere. This means that users&#x2019; security is more vulnerable to malware, phishing and identity theft.<br><br></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Proprietary strong authentication is not scalable.</span>&#xA0;Websites like PayPal and eBay have millions of users worldwide. Most of the strong authentication solutions that are available today are not very easy to use.&#xA0; At PayPal, we believe that our customers deserve authentication solutions that are both strong, and easy to use.<br><br></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Threats continue to evolve.</span>&#xA0;Traditional phishing, malware, script attacks and other threats exist, but they are becoming more targeted and moving to mobile devices. The defenses are evolving, albeit slowly, and so we want to do what we can to move the adoption of stronger, and easier to use authentication on all platforms, not just the traditional PC.</li></ul><span style=\"\">Why FIDO?</span>&#xA0;<ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">FIDO will give users stronger and easier authentication options &#x2013; beyond passwords.</span>&#xA0;Users will be able to select the type of authentication that suits them best from a broad range of options &#x2013; from fingerprinting scanning to USB tokens. In most cases FIDO devices will provide a two-factor authentication or can be used as a strong second factor. By moving beyond passwords, FIDO reduces users&#x2019; exposure to phishing and weak security at poorly managed websites.<br><br></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">FIDO is an open standard.</span>&#xA0;FIDO supports a wide variety of security devices so you are not locked into a single vendor. Since the FIDO client can run on any platform, there is no need for lengthy and expensive integration for each website.<br><br></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">FIDO will scale for large websites and large enterprises.</span>&#xA0;In most cases users will acquire their FIDO device and be responsible for its replacement. This removes the management cost that limits authentication token deployment for large companies.</li></ul>Although the vision of the FIDO Alliance strong authentication ecosystem will not come to life overnight, we believe it is compelling. We encourage other companies to join us in the FIDO Alliance and to find ways to make online authentication easier and more secure for all our customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

For developers, this trend moves beyond just consumer behavior to a democratization of the mobile development space.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>John Lunn, global director of PayPal&#x2019;s Developer Network, shares why there&#x2019;s never been a more urgent time to pay attention to mobile development.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">HTML5 Takes Over</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Until recently, native apps drove the development community on mobile. Developer teams would assemble resources, choose an initial platform, such as iOS or Android, on which to develop a product or app and ship it at high cost both in funding and in time. But 2013 is HTML5&#x2019;s year. According to Lunn, the mobile industry is coming to &#x201C;a stage where a less skilled developer can write apps very fast with compatibility across multiple devices.&#x201D; This &#x201C;democratization&#x201D; of web-based mobile development will speed the rate of mobile innovation in nearly every industry.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Mobile Device Price Wars</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Mobile device makers across all platforms have begun to price their devices down, allowing more consumers and developers to gain access to products, payments and information. Speculation abounds that even Apple is set to announce a more affordable iPhone this year. Combined with widespread HTML5 development, mobile apps will become exponentially more affordable to develop and ship and they&#x2019;ll reach more consumers than ever before.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Cloud Service Becomes the Norm</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For industries to fully tap into the mobile market, cloud-based services must become ubiquitous across multiple platforms. Developers focusing on shipping robust, secure mobile products based in the cloud will enable the multi-screen experiences and cheap devices that rely on it, something consumers crave.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;It&apos;s going to come down to the companies that make your life easier on mobile, rather than just accommodate it,&#x201D; says Lunn.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>These trends are all interconnected and compound on each another.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Just ask Scott Henshaw, PayPal Ambassador and co-owner of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.nanettestore.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Nanette Store</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://scotthenshaw.com/products-page/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Motor Del Sol</a>. As a merchant with a presence both in-person at Seattle&#x2019;s famous Pike Place Market and online, Henshaw uses PayPal Here to maintain brand consistency and quality.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;PayPal Here allows me to stay engaged with the buyers, instead of just saying &#x2018;Thanks, have a nice day,&#x2019;&#x201D; Henshaw says. &#xA0;His four favorite features?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">#1. Increased Vendor Security</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Before he set up PayPal Here, Henshaw&#x2019;s iPad transactions took up to five minutes to complete&#x2014;keeping his eyes off his merchandise and the busy crowds eyeing it. PayPal Here &#x201C;put the technology in my pocket and changed transactions from five minute operations to 45 seconds,&#x201D; Henshaw says.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">#2. Increased Transaction Volume</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Another benefit of decreased transaction time is the ability to keep up with the pace of sales in a fast moving market like Pike Place. While other sellers are forced to reject credit cards or enter transactions manually, Henshaw is able to &#x201C;keep up with credit card transactions at a cash pace,&#x201D; allowing him to make more sales than his competitors.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">#3. Diffuses Cash Carry Disagreements</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Customers not carrying much cash are a common problem in the local market environment. Sellers might have a great product, but potential customers aren&#x2019;t carrying enough cash, forcing sellers to negotiate. PayPal Here allows sellers to diffuse this issue by allowing customers to access their bank accounts and pay for products in whatever manner they prefer.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">#4. Brands the In-Person Transaction</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Many sellers meticulously maintain their brands online. Why not bring that to the local transaction as well? According to Henshaw, PayPal Here allows sellers to combine the traditional local transaction and &#x201C;combine it with modern tech and branding to stay engaged&#x201D; with modern customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For example, when Henshaw sells chairs to a real estate agent, he will brand the receipt with his website, social media accounts and photos of the product. It allows buyers to &#x201C;remember the experience and my brand,&#x201D; increasing the likelihood of repeat customers.&#xA0;PayPal Here allows customers &#x201C;to not just take sellers&#x2019; money, but also remember the experience,&#x201D; says Henshaw.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

We were honored that Ireland&#x2019;s Prime Minister, An Taoiseach Enda Kenny T.D., officially opened eBay Inc.&#x2019;s new European operations center in Dundalk. The new center provides support for millions of PayPal and eBay customers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.&#xA0;&#xA0; We&apos;re creating jobs in customer service, telesales, risk and financial operations and account management so it truly is a site which will support all areas of PayPal&apos;s business.&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;<br>Ireland has been a great partner to PayPal. We&#x2019;ve greatly valued the support of the Taoiseach and his government colleagues, IDA Ireland and the local authorities and communities in Dublin and Dundalk. But most of all, I&#x2019;d like to pay tribute to all our people in Ireland. They made the country the natural home for our newest European operations center.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve already hired 385 people in Dundalk, and expect to employ 1,450 by 2015. This is on top of over 2,000 people working for PayPal and eBay at our existing sites in Dublin.&#xA0; Ireland is rich with talented individuals and we&apos;re expecting our workforce to include graduates, school leavers and people joining us later in their careers.&#xA0; Our customer service team will speak multiple languages ranging from French to Russian to Polish &#x2013; and we are&#xA0;<a title=\"hiring\" href=\"http://www.ebaycareers.com/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">hiring</a>.&#xA0; We are looking forward to partnering with the local community in Dundalk, and beyond, to find and train our new employees.<br>&#xA0;<br>In tough economic times it&apos;s great to create new jobs, but at PayPal we believe that we do more than create jobs, we create opportunities for consumers and businesses through our seamless shopping experiences whether on PC, tablets, smartphones or in store.&#xA0;&#xA0; We&apos;re looking forward to helping businesses in Ireland and worldwide grow by connecting them with consumers, and enabling those consumers to shop anytime, anywhere by pioneering easier ways to pay, especially on mobile.&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;<br>The Dundalk opening comes 10 years after we opened our first offices in Ireland, with just 25 people. By 2015, we expect to employ over 3,600 in Dublin and Dundalk. That amazing expansion reflects how quickly PayPal and eBay have grown in Europe and beyond.&#xA0; That shows the success of our mission to create new opportunities for consumers and businesses through connected commerce.&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;<br>Dundalk is a special place for me. My grandfather was born there, moving to America at the age of 14. I was thinking of him today when Taoiseach Enda Kenny opened our new center just down the road from his boyhood home.&#xA0; He was a man that enjoyed serving customers and his community his entire adult life and I know how proud he would be of his Dundalk family as they serve the PayPal customers and that community.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Since then, the payment industry has gone global and mobile payments have virtually exploded. With this growth, the complexity of keeping up with regulations, industry challenges and the competition has meant his team has gone from one person 12 years ago to about 80 today.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Still, from John&apos;s perspective, the more things change, the more they can stay the same. Recently, he sat down with us to chat about his story, how he sees the industry and his favorite purchase made with PayPal.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Q: Both PayPal and the industry has changed quite a bit since you came on board, correct?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>A: That&apos;s true. The company was basically a year old when I joined and definitely a lot smaller than today. But even then it was growing pretty fast. As for the industry, a lot of the same issues that were important 12 years ago are still important today. For example, debit and credit cards are still vital to our business model, and issues around innovation and helping merchants succeed still take center stage.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Q: What a</strong><strong style=\"\">re some of the key industry changes you&apos;re seeing?</strong><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>A: Increased globalization, for one. Mobile payments, of course, and different ways to accept payments beyond the traditional check out terminal. Regulations have changed in both complexity and scope. For example, while anti-money laundering (AML) regulations existed in 2000, there have been new requirements that have come in over the years, such as specific disclosures/requirements for international remittances.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Q: You and your team have a lot of responsibility when it comes to navigating the regulatory landscape, both here and abroad. Can you offer a quick overview of how you see the kinds of challenges PayPal is facing today?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>A: &#xA0;Complexity, certainly. That&apos;s what takes an 80 person team to deal with today. Even within the U.S., uniformity doesn&apos;t exist across states in regulation of payment companies. That&apos;s even more so outside of the country. Regulations in the EU are different than Australia or Japan or Singapore. And now, we&apos;re about to get a license in Russia, which is different yet again. So that creates a lot of complexity, both on the legal side and on the product side, having to build in the different elements to make our service compliant.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Q: Is PayPal helping to lead the way in helping shape the regulatory landscape in any way? Is it a role the company should have?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A: I think it is a role we have and want to do more of. There are limited resources and only so much time in the day, of course. Essentially, it&apos;s true for most businesses - you have a point of view on how your business should be regulated, and within whatever resources you do have, you want your voice to be heard. The challenge in the payment world is there is no industry association, at least not yet, that really speaks to the voice of the internet- and mobile-focused payment business.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At PayPal, we take a responsibility to lead. We want to promote international trade, lower trade barriers and increase opportunities for businesses around the world. We want to be a voice for these and advocacy for policy is one way to do that. So we look to be active in the technology industry trade associations, and we want to be commenting on proposed regulations, meeting with regulators and attending industry conferences as much as we can.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Q: Since you joined, what&apos;s your favorite item you&apos;ve purchased with PayPal?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A: My wife is a big Boston Celtics fan, and in 2003 the home of the Celtics-formerly the Boston Garden-ran a charity auction to rename the building after anyone you wanted. I won the auction, and had the marquee read &quot;Linda Walton Garden&quot; for a day. So that was her Valentines Day gift for that year.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

In honor of this special day, we want to highlight how PayPal Here and the PayPal app can make it easier on you and your babysitter when it&#x2019;s time to pay.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Have you ever come home after a fun night out and realized you forgot to pick up cash to pay the babysitter? Having cash and making correct change is the last thing on your mind after all. PayPal understands how busy parents are - managing kids, jobs, housework, social lives, bills and more. Sometimes it&#x2019;s simply impossible to keep cash on hand. With PayPal Here and the PayPal app, the stress of scrounging for cash is gone! Paying the babysitter goes from looking for money under the sofa cushions to using any of your cards or 3 taps on your mobile device.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\">Your babysitters will reap the benefits too since they will no longer have to manage cash or deposit the money to their bank account. Before they walk out the door, their payment can be in their PayPal account, which is instantly linked to their bank account.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Even if your babysitter is not 18 yet, they can sign-up for a&#xA0;</span><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/student-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal student account</a><span style=\"\">. With the help of their parents, they can set-up an account and begin accepting money right away! With PayPal Here and the PayPal app, your babysitter can start learning money management skills and literally be their own boss.</span><br><br><span style=\"\">May 11th may be National Babysitter&#x2019;s Day, but PayPal celebrates babysitters every day, by taking the stress out of cash payments.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">In the comments below, tell us where you&#x2019;re going the next time you hire a babysitter.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">About the author, Dave Peck: I have 5 kids, 1 hamster, 1 wife and a puppy. I am busy. I am tired. I am always looking for a way to make my life easier and therefore, we are incredibly appreciative of our babysitters.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"><br></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

Russia is no exception.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As required by the National Payment System Law, we officially applied for a Non-Banking Credit Institution license (NBCI) in Russia.

My team implemented this simple, secure, device agnostic solution for accessing funds in a PayPal account via a PIN that we create for them in advance and without ever having to tell them what their new PIN is. But how does that work?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PINs are attractive for public shared devices such as ATMs and CoinStar machines for two main reasons: they are familiar and easy to use, and they don&#x2019;t require the customer&#x2019;s full password used to protect sensitive personal and financial information. But, the challenge with PINs is that a good PIN is hard to remember, which leads to re-use across multiple services and poor PIN selection such as 1111, 1234, year-of-birth, etc.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our innovation addresses these problems by deriving PINs from passwords using an algorithm that creates a numerical PIN based on the first four digits of a PayPal user&#x2019;s password. By doing so, we limit the number of credentials our customers have to remember. If you know your password, you know your PIN, which makes the user experience simpler, and incidentally, more secure.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here&#x2019;s what Mike Skinner, President of Coin for Coinstar, had to say about this solution:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#x201C;Coinstar coin-counting kiosks allow people to securely add coins and paper currency to a PayPal account from the convenience of select grocery store locations where the PayPal functionality is available. &#xA0;Customers can quickly use those funds anywhere PayPal is accepted or withdraw cash from their PayPal account.

As one of the largest, most trusted online payments service around the globe, nobody can grow with a developer&#x2019;s business the way that PayPal can. We connect 123 million account holders across more than 50 financial networks in 190 markets and in 25 currencies around the world.

Customers never leave the developer&#x2019;s app experience to pay and they have more choice in the way they want to pay &#x2013; simply click a PayPal button or scan a credit card using our&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2012/07/paypal-acquires-card-io/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">card.io technology</a>.

Last year at this time we&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">launched</span><span style=\"\">PayPal Here in the U.S., Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. Small business owners of all kinds, from non-profits to hair stylists, to roofers, landscapers and more, immediately embraced this new payments solution to help them get paid no matter where or how they were doing business. Now a year in and we&#x2019;re seeing fantastic momentum worldwide as small businesses everywhere adopt PayPal Here.</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This isn&#x2019;t surprising since a survey by Bank of America last year found that 45% of 1,000 small business owners cited &#x201C;not getting paid on time by clients and customers&#x201D; as the biggest challenge they faced when managing their cash flow. PayPal Here helps businesses get paid fast, easily and securely from a name they can trust.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So as we wish PayPal Here a Happy Birthday, we&#x2019;re thrilled and pretty proud that it&#x2019;s becoming such a world traveler:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">PayPal Here in Japan</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Just last week we&#xA0;<span style=\"\">announced</span>&#xA0;the full-scale retail expansion of PayPal Here in Japan through our joint venture with SoftBank, a leading telecom and mobile Internet company in Japan. It is now available in more than 2,700 SoftBank retail locations and business sales networks across the country and available for both iOS and Android mobile OS platforms.<span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>SoftBank and PayPal are first-to-market in Japan with a mobile payment technology like PayPal Here to help more than 4.2 million small businesses, which account for 99% of all businesses in Japan and of which 80% still do not accept credit card transactions.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Since PayPal Here started selling in SoftBank Mobile stores last fall, thousands of Japanese small business owners have used it to grow their sales and have provided valuable feedback to help us enhance the total customer experience. With SoftBank&#x2019;s countrywide store network and thousands of sales staff, we&#x2019;re going to bring PayPal Here to the vast majority of small businesses in Japan.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Launch of Chip and PIN version of PayPal Here</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>On February 21<span style=\"\">st</span>&#xA0;we&#xA0;<span style=\"\">announced</span>&#xA0;that PayPal Here will be available in the U.K. this summer and eventually available in those countries that use Chip and PIN debit and credit cards. Aside from the product being tailored to this specific market, this version offers all the same ease and functionality of PayPal Here in the U.S. and elsewhere and demonstrates our commitment to our customers to listen to them and respond with products that meet their specific needs.<span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We showcased the Chip and PIN version of PayPal Here at the vibrant Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to an overwhelmingly positive reception. And British small business owners have reacted with enthusiasm. Within days of the announcement, we saw more than 11,000 people registering their interest in the device.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">PayPal Here iPad Version Now Available in U.S.!</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And finally, we&#x2019;re thrilled to announce that today the PayPal Here app optimized for the iPad is now&#xA0;<span style=\"\">available</span>&#xA0;in the United States.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In order to create innovative technology like PayPal Here that makes small business owners&#x2019; lives easier, we collaborate with them to understand their pain points so we can solve real problems. In listening to our customers we learned that while all love the convenience, security and functionality of PayPal Here, some prefer the larger screen of the iPad.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So with that in mind we went about designing a new version of the PayPal Here app that would work seamlessly and beautifully with the iPad. Some of the new features include:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">App designed specifically for the iPad</li><li style=\"\">Ability to scan an item&#x2019;s barcode for faster checkout</li><li style=\"\">Wirelessly connect to a cash drawer and printer</li><li style=\"\">Track sales activity in &#x201C;Daily Summary&#x201D; reporting</li></ul>Leveraging eBay inc. technology (Red Laser), the bar code scanning feature lets merchants easily scan in items they sell to their Item List, and also provides a fast checkout experience for customers.<span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal Here for iPad is designed for small retail storefronts, sole proprietors, offices, or businesses who want to accept payments more simply with an easy to set up, scalable mobile payment solution that grows with their business.&#xA0;It&#x2019;s perfect for those small businesses that don&#x2019;t already have an existing solution, but we are also working with dozens of existing vendors that supply retail POS solutions &#x2013; from large ones like NCR to mid-market providers like Shopkeep, Leapset, Vend, Kounta and Erply &#x2013; so that we can offer businesses new ways to connect with their customers without ripping out their existing solutions.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>All of these initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide demonstrate our commitment to helping small business owners take and make payments in a simple and secure way no matter how or where they do business. And, most importantly, PayPal Here helps them ensure they never miss a sales opportunity again so they can sell more.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Now that&#x2019;s something everyone can understand, no matter what language they speak.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

It&apos;s certainly a great catch phrase and makes for an easy headline, but what are we really talking about? A mobile wallet&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;a digital wallet&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;a cloud wallet&#xA0;&#x2026;.&#xA0;or whatever you want to call it&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;is really just another way to store your money and pay for the things you want. And we&apos;re constraining ourselves by looking back towards a physical item when technology is taking us so much further forward.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Paying for things is something PayPal transformed nearly 15 years ago, and we have seen an amazing runway of new developments since then. We do more mobile payment volume than anyone else -- $14 Billion last year, a 250 percent increase in a single year. We also released exciting updates for the iPad and, just this week, the&#xA0;<a title=\"Android platform\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/innovation/paypal-launches-android-sdk-for-developers/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Android platform</a>.

Mobile plays a key part, but it&apos;s not just about paying for a smoothie or coffee with your phone (or anything else), or just adding and holding your financial information on your phone. The opportunity is more than that - it&apos;s about solving real customer problems that make shopping experiences more seamless, connected, friction free and almost intuitive.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal can help your favorite burger joint start that plate of sweet potato fries the second you check-in and order ahead. At the coffee shop, you shouldn&apos;t have to wait in line, order and pay for coffee. By knowing who you are before you walk in, the barista can have your favorite drink ready. It&apos;s a clothing store thinking ahead for you and delivering highly personalized offers based on who you are, where you are and what you&apos;ve done in the past (and might do in the future). It&apos;s about relevant and real time coupons and offers that are tailored specifically to each user.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Enabling these elegant experiences and connections for consumers and retailers is what we&apos;re working on everyday at PayPal. We&apos;re finding new ways that both simplify our daily lives and make exciting things possible to deepen our connections to merchants and each other. We&apos;re turning all those 1s and 0s into something far more personal and meaningful than simply exchanging currency. &#xA0;&#xA0;That isn&apos;t a catch phrase.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I don&apos;t know about you, but I&apos;m looking forward to the day where I can lose my wallet altogether - both the word and the physical object.&#xA0; There&apos;s so much more we can do with technology, there&apos;s so much more we can do to make life easier for our customers everyday, and I don&apos;t want words, a catch phrase or misconceptions to hold us back.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&apos;re just PayPal.

Today we released the proof that the majority of consumers worldwide really would like to do just that.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We conducted a&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130521006662/en/PayPal-Global-Study-Spells-Doom-Wallet\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">global study</a>&#xA0;in five large markets: the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Germany.&#xA0; The results are in and strengthen the notion that carrying around your financial information, credit cards, and cash in a wallet is simply just a pain. At PayPal, we want to remove friction from the financial equation. So we asked 5000 consumers around the world where and when that happens. &#xA0;&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Some of the anecdotal data was entertaining, such as&#x2026; apparently no one wants sand in their wallets. In every market, the beach is the number one place people&#xA0;<span style=\"\">don&apos;t</span>&#xA0;want their wallets. Maybe you&apos;d expect that in Australia, but in Germany or Northern Canada?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Overall, the data that came back showed that what people want most of all is to lose their wallets. In every country we surveyed, at least 3 of 4 respondents said they wished they didn&apos;t have to carry their wallets around with them.&#xA0; A vast majority (83%) of respondents across five countries said they wished they didn&apos;t have to carry a wallet. Additionally, nearly one in three Americans (29%) would choose a smartphone over a wallet if they could only bring one item when going out. &#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While American consumers are keen to move to a digital payment future, the businesses that serve them may be lagging behind. More than two-thirds of Americans (68%) reported they have been unable to pay for something because they didn&apos;t have cash with them; for nearly one in three Americans (30%), this has happened frequently.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So, what people are saying is that they lose their spare change, they wish they weren&apos;t tied to their wallets, and they often aren&apos;t able to buy something because they don&apos;t have cash. Conclusion? We have a real opportunity to make people&apos;s lives easier &#x2026; an opportunity to make shopping experiences more seamless, connected, friction-free and intuitive.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As we expand offline and into more and more stores, like&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.radioshack.com/home/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Radio Shack</a>,<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=2255956\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Toys &quot;R&quot; Us</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ae.com/web/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">American Eagle Outfitters</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://jambajuice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Jamba Juice</a>&#xA0;and our other retail partners, we can help free more and more consumers from the shackles of the wallet. Jamba Juice, in fact, has been testing our Order Ahead program - where consumers can order and pay for their smoothies before they even get to the store.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The consumer sentiment this new survey shows is more proof that we&apos;re truly on the cusp of a transformational moment with regards to how consumers will make every day financial transactions. People are ready for the day when the notion of carrying around a bulky wallet to pay for things will seem as antiquated as Gordon Gekko&apos;s enormous mobile phone in the movie Wall Street seems to us today.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Think of PayPal as the network that connects everyone, consumers, merchants, developers alike, and&#xA0;enables&#xA0;their money to flow seamlessly.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal assists in all things related to payments.&#xA0; For us, it&apos;s the beginning of a great adventure to help usher this transformation into consumers&apos; lives, and to use the power of technology to bring them an experience that is not only secure, simple and extremely useful but, yes, a lot more fun.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Tell us in the comments below if you&apos;re ready to ditch your wallet, too!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>David Marcus<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>President, PayPal<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Valley Verde is an organization that sought out low-income residents of Santa Clara County, and provided backyard gardens, or &quot;home-grown&quot; food sourcing solutions that saved participants an average of $700/year. Valley Verde&apos;s current garden-production methods and subsequent profit margins were far too low to reach the growth it desired, so PayPal employees sought out a more cost effective solution -- Wine barrels. Bringing a &quot;mobile&quot; solution to a garden gave Valley Verde the cost-effective solution it was looking for to grow the organization and assist even more residents than ever before.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Norton, Global Manager, Employee Engagement/Social Innovation, eBay Inc.</strong><br><br>Every year, on one particular day, usually during the first week or two of May, thousands of cyclists, and the cycling curious, take over the streets of the Bay Area. May itself is National Bike Month, but this one day marks Bike to Work Day, and companies nationwide encourage their employees to ditch the car and put their pedals to the metal for their commute to and from work. This year, May 9th marked Bike to Work Day here in the Bay Area.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>eBay Inc. has been a strong supporter of Bike to Work Day here in the Bay Area for several years, as well as in many of our offices around the country. &#xA0;We also have very strong cycling groups in our Omaha, NE and Salt Lake City, UT offices. &#xA0;We see Bike to Work Day not only as a chance to participate in a fun event, but to also support a group dedicated solely to promoting a two-wheeled commute every day of the year - &#xA0;the&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://bikesiliconvalley.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition</a>. We see this as a great opportunity to continue to spread a strong environmental message to our employees and our community as well. &#xA0;It&apos;s also a chance to encourage a healthier lifestyle and it cuts back on employee stress for the day from having to find a parking spot in the morning (you should see our parking lots!). &#xA0;There&apos;s nothing quite like a little fresh air and exercise first thing in the morning to get your day started off on the right foot.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This year, over 100 eBay Inc. employees from both our San Jose, CA campuses participated in Bike to Work Day. They were all treated to breakfast upon arrival and were given an opportunity to enter a Bike to Work Day raffle, featuring all kinds of great bike commuter-related prizes. &#xA0;Our local cycling group also volunteered to staff a Cycling Coalition table along a major morning commuting route not far from our South Campus. &#xA0;Our South Campus also had a mobile bike shop set-up onsite to help with minor repairs and talk bike maintenance with curious employees. &#xA0;As a side note, we have a bike mechanic on site at each campus once every two weeks for employees who need work done. We figured it&apos;d be a nice perk to encourage cycling if employees are able to have their bikes worked on while at work, rather than having to make appointments with the local bike shop, which would often require them to leave it for a few days (usually on weekends) to get work done.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Overall, it was another impressive turnout. &#xA0;Happily, our headcount continues to increase with each passing year. We hope to one day have a completely empty parking lot on Bike to Work Day (we can dream, right?!). Now go dust off your own bike, grab that helmet and do something for yourself and the planet this weekend by going for a nice long bike ride (then do it more and more often until it becomes a habit).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

The evidence is all around us. Consumers can buy what they want anytime, anywhere and, thanks to the ubiquity of mobile, consumer expectations about how they engage with physical retail environments have changed as well. Shopping is now a highly customized experience. Want to order from a food truck and pay by swiping a credit card and &#x201C;signing&#x201D; with your finger? Done. Forgot your iPad charger and need one delivered to your office desk in an hour? No problem. As technology and commerce converge, we will continue to shape the future for a truly personalized shopping experience.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This ability for consumers to shop not only online and offline, but also locally and globally, is why eBay Inc. is particularly excited about its latest shopping innovation.

Though this is only a month-long experiment, both Kate Spade parent company Fifth &amp; Pacific Inc. and eBay Inc. are excited about the prospect of revolutionizing shopping. With about 40% of all retail spending in the U.S. now involving some kind of online engagement, interactive glass technology allows retailers to think about cubic versus square feet for their retail shops.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>eBay Inc. is proud to be at the forefront of exploring new innovations that help drive the future of shopping. One can&#x2019;t be an innovation leader without taking risks. Companies need to push the boundaries of digital technology in order to fuel more connected commerce. In the future, we see commerce as both local and global, online and offline, where big and small players can succeed with each other, not in spite of each other. Only then can we all share in more opportunity together.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

But, how do you log in on a device that has no keyboard, that does not have strong support for biometric authentication, and where you have to be concerned that every move you make is observed -- and may be recorded -- by somebody who wants to know your login?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For example, how do you log in with a wearable device such as an exercise band or digital glasses? In many situations, you probably do not want to speak your PIN, password or mother&#x2019;s maiden name, out of concern that somebody would learn what it is.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Say that you are on a train. You are reading an advertisement, and decide that you would like to buy that product or service. You look towards the bar code displayed in the corner of the advertisement, and you say &#x201C;Ok, buy.&#x201D; You see the price on the small screen of your wearable device, and you are asked for your PIN to confirm the purchase -- that is how the vendor knows that it is you, and not just anyone with access to your wearable device. What&#x2019;s next?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>You do not want to speak your PIN. Or gesture it. But here is what you can do, using patented technology developed by PayPal researchers.<br><br>First, the payment service provider displays a random PIN to you on your screen. Say, 1394. With a small cursor box around the first digit. Nobody but you can see this.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But wait, you say, my PIN is 1024. How can 1394 help me get to the right PIN? Well, let&#x2019;s explore that!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Is the first digit correct? Yes it is. So you move the cursor to the right -- whether by saying &#x201C;next&#x201D; or by sliding the touch sensor on the frame of your device.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Now the cursor is over the digit 3.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Is that digit correct? Nope. You say &#x201C;less&#x201D;, &#x201C;less&#x201D;, &#x201C;less&#x201D;, or slide your finger three times backwards on your frame. And the 3 changes to a 0. So now you say &#x201C;next&#x201D; or slide upwards to move the cursor to the next digit, and follow the same process.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>You could say &#x201C;less&#x201D; seven times, or &#x201C;more&#x201D; three times, or slide your finger backwards or forwards that same number of times. For each voice command or each touch, the digit on the screen changes, and you see what the current PIN is.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When you are done -- the PIN on the screen should say 1024. You say &#x201C;Done&#x201D; or double-tap on the frame, and your PIN is encrypted and submitted to the financial service provider.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And here is the charm: nobody, but you knows your PIN because nobody knows the random PIN shown originally.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This is only an example of the advanced authentication technologies PayPal is developing. Tomorrow, June 27, I will be speaking about security advances in wearable security at the&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://csf2013.seas.harvard.edu/program.html#Jakobsson\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">CSF conference</a>&#xA0;at Tulane University in New Orleans.

Loyalty is also built into the app so you can see how many coffees you have purchased from a caf&#xE9; and automatically get a free coffee when you are entitled to it without having to remember a physical loyalty card.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The customer&#x2019;s order then appears on the caf&#xE9;&#x2019;s point of sale terminal screen so they can get the order ready in time for the customer&#x2019;s arrival &#x2013; allowing PayPal customers to feel like a rock star as they zip past the queue and pick up their order as soon as they walk in.

Stories from the employees who went were moving and their lives were transformed by the experience.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This year, eBay Inc increased the opportunities to participate. In addition to returning to last year&#x2019;s countries, they expanded the program to build sites in the United States as well, where there also is tremendous need.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Prashanthi Ravanavarapu, an eBay Inc employee, participated in the build that took place in Sichuan, China. Here is a brief overview of her experience:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The Habitat For Humanity (HFH) trip to Sichuan, China was amazing! It was everything and more than I expected. While I am extremely overwhelmed and saddened by some of the realities in this remote part of the world, I am inspired by other aspects.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It felt great to know that we made a direct impact and were part of making somebody&apos;s dream a reality. In some of these cases, we were helping an individual who had never even dreamed of ever having a humble home. HFH scouts these families and helps them. There is no application process. Mr. Zhou, the homeowner we helped in Sichuan, couldn&apos;t even believe that it was happening. Even on the day we started to build the house, he was in disbelief. Now, he and his 94-year old mom are thrilled to have a home they can be proud of. eBay Inc helped fund 3 such homes in Sichuan this year and the entire team was touched by the stories of these families. In total, eBay Inc funded 30 homes around the world and sent teams to 5 different sites.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We had an amazing team in Sichuan, which consisted of 16 people from across the company and from different locations in the world. Despite the earthquake that hit very close to our build site, the whole team showed up to work.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The goal was to build at least one wall up to 1m. We built the side walls up to 2.5m and all the other walls to 1.5m. HFH partners said we were the most goal oriented team they had ever seen. We almost always shortened our 90-minute lunch to 30 minutes so we could get back to work. We moved 10,000 bricks, dug foundations, mixed mortar, moved mud, laid bricks and had fun doing it. We all walked away with immense gratitude for this opportunity.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Here are a few of our leadership learnings and observations:</strong><br>Shared Purpose: When a team of people have a common goal (shared purpose), they will go above and beyond any physical, emotional or other issues to ensure that the goal is achieved. In our case, we beat all of our goals in less time and with a smile on our faces. There is no room for ego or politics.<ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Direct Impact Inspires</span>: When an individual feels like he/she is making a positive impact directly to another life, the energy they bring to work is intense.<br><br></span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Keeping Up the Team Spirit</span>: It is up to the leader to ensure that they provide the right tools and resources for their teams. If not, the teams might begin to feel like they are not delivering well. In our case, we kept running out of brick, mortar and tools so some of the team members felt like they were not be utilized completely. The leaders of the team worked hard to keep the morale of all team members high.</span></li></ul><strong style=\"\">After the HFH Trip</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>While I am overwhelmed with the needs in this world and sad that we can only do so much, I am committed to keep growing so that I can have more impact. I am committed to plant more seeds of little bits of good so that those around me might be inspired to take it forward<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

As a result, both unit sales price and total sales volume have increased,&quot; commented Mr. Hiroyuki Miyazaki, CEO of Aquarylis, a jewelry shop that sells high-quality, hand-crafted stone jewelry at exhibitions in Tokyo and Osaka, as well as through face-to-face sales opportunities.</span></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">&#x201C;PayPal Here has no monthly charge and an easy transaction process, so we are happy to recommend our customers to pay via credit card. Also, our sales team comments that PayPal Here enables credit card payments at sales visits to yoyo competitions and exhibition events. Moreover, sales from our online and physical stores can be completed through PayPal, an easier way to manage overall sales transactions for our business,&#x201D; commented Mr. Masahiro Noma, CEO of YoYo Company which has a shop called Rewind located in Aichi prefecture, selling a range of popular yoyos including professional models for world competitions.</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&quot;After introducing PayPal Here, it is a more convenient way to pay for customers and we are able to grow our sales by offering more payment choices to our customers. Although the transaction fee cost is 5% of sales, the amount of lost business by not offering credit card acceptance is even higher,&quot; commented Mr. Daisuke Tanaka, CEO of Uniginal Ltd., managing company of Milton Coffee Roastery, a cafe located in South Yamaguchi prefecture.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&quot;Three weeks after we started, we saw that payments via PayPal Here were already 10%.

We knew this was not a positive experience for our customers and we&apos;ve been working hard to make this situation better.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our new approach begins with an automated screening for payments that are possibly in violation of sanctions.&#xA0; Then for most sellers, instead of automatically declining these payments, we place these transactions in pending status while our team reviews the transaction within 72 hours, less whenever possible. This review determines whether the payment has been inaccurately identified and should be processed. Today, we are trying to reduce the disruption of having payments automatically declined, and to deliver a better experience for both our consumer and merchant customers by working quickly to allow the transaction to proceed, when appropriate.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>However, we understand that having a transaction held for 72 hours is still disruptive for affected customers. That is why we are continuously refining our processes and technologies to reduce the number of payments that are delayed but eventually cleared. Today, this process affects only 0.04% of payments flowing through our service, but we aim to make this even lower.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Every transaction for every one of our customers matters to us. Our goal is to deliver a seamless payments experience when our customers use PayPal &#x2013; no exceptions.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&apos;ve had some recent feedback from affected customers, which I&#x2019;d also like to address. &#xA0;We want to be very clear - this policy was never intended to apply to informational materials like books, magazines, CDs and DVDs. While we have worked to ensure as much as possible that informational materials are not affected by our compliance with this policy, sometimes transactions involving informational materials are held pending review by mistake. This happens because it is not always easy for our automated systems to understand when a payment involves informational materials, especially when we don&#x2019;t know if the seller may sell both informational materials and other items. We regret the frustration that this may cause, and are working hard to improve our systems to reduce these errors.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

As he got older, he realized he wasn&#x2019;t as mobile on a board as he used to be and was looking for a way to find more speed while skimboarding. He wrangled together some scientists and surfers to come up with a special, organic compound (no eels were hurt in the making of the product) that water cannot adhere to and that is applied to surf and skim boards and boats for a smoother, quicker ride. Thanks to Eelsnot, Toby who is turning 40 this year remains the East Coat&#x2019;s undefeated skimboarding champion in his age group.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But being mobile in the water isn&#x2019;t the only thing important to Toby.

PayPal Here let&#x2019;s Toby take his business out of the water and onto the road. In just two months he&#x2019;s raked in about $5,000 from swiping more than 200 customer credit cards across the country at the beach, trade shows, boat shows, marinas, special events and more (and no, he does not put Eelsnot on the card reader so cards swipe faster)! He&#x2019;s even started to carry a PayPal Here reader everywhere he goes and is often hailed at traffic lights by water sport enthusiasts to make a sale right out of his truck. Today, Eelsnot is available in 15 different countries and 25 different surf shops.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Interested in having your small business PayPal success story told?

The twenty-something turned her love for handmade products and beautiful packaging into a business that would put even the most perfectly wrapped products on Pinterest to shame. Erin&#x2019;s philosophy is that modern and nostalgic and uncomplicated details make a package. We couldn&#x2019;t agree more.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>What is this sparkly cotton twine, exactly? It&#x2019;s 2&#x201D; x 4&#x201D; spools of twine that Erin coined &#x201C;the original Glitter Twine.&#x201D; The spools are available in gold/natural and silver/natural and truly do add a metallic twist to any package.

This Glitter Twine works on just about every package for every occasion.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Erin has been crafting and making for as long as she can remember.

Her business started in her own apartment, but recently moved to their own brick and mortar studio location in Gowanus, Brooklyn. She shares that her studio &#x201C;quite often feels like a candy shop&#x201D; with the bright colorful products scattered around. Our candy-inspired Knot and Bow favorite is the signature confetti bombs &#x2013; packaged tightly in a crystal clear tube. The confetti is available in white metallic or the Knot and Bow classic party mix &#x2013; both perfect for any celebration!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Erin finds inspiration in a lot of places, but mostly through her two children and living in New York.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">July 18<br><strong style=\"\">David Marcus, President, PayPal</strong><br>As the founder of a number of successful startups before joining PayPal in 2011, I&#x2019;ve led companies through periods of rapid and sustained growth before. It&#x2019;s always exciting to rack up big increases in the key metrics you use to gauge success. But achieving impressive gains is one thing when your company is small and you&#x2019;re starting from relatively small numbers. It&#x2019;s another thing altogether for a global company like PayPal where we&#x2019;re building off a much larger base.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So I&#x2019;m very pleased to share some pretty remarkable second quarter results for PayPal. First of all, we enabled more than 700 million transactions during April, May and June. This an all-time high for the company, topping last year&#x2019;s very busy holiday season. Our second quarter total payment volume climbed to $43 billion, up 25 percent on an FX neutral basis. Merchant services (off-eBay transactions) reached $30 billion, up 29 percent year-over-year. Revenue rose to $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 21 percent on an FX neutral basis. We welcomed nearly 5 million new customers during the quarter, bringing total active accounts to more than 132 million.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Another number that I&#x2019;m proud is year-over-year international revenue growth of 21 percent, to more than $827 million. This is a clear sign to me that our ability to deliver great experiences is resonating with customers around the globe.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While I love numbers, they don&#x2019;t tell the whole story. It&#x2019;s just as important to note that we&#x2019;re introducing better experiences and groundbreaking technology advances at an ever-accelerating pace as we strive to continually improve the lives of our customers by delivering better, simpler financial services and products around the world.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Simply put we continue to innovate. In the UK, we introduced our new Chip &amp; PIN PayPal Here reader. It&#x2019;s already transforming the commercial lives of our first UK PayPal Here customers by making it fast and simple to accept credit card payments. By integrating PayPal with a rapidly-growing number of leading POS systems, we&#x2019;re eliminating payment friction in places where people shop, dine, and fuel-up. With our brand new&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.paypal.com/cashforregisters\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Cash For Registers</a>&#xA0;program in the US we&#x2019;re giving merchants the opportunity to move beyond the traditional cash register by using the PayPal Here and a mobile card reader to accept payments anywhere in a store.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In addition, we unveiled new checkout experiences and business servicing platforms in a number of new markets around the globe. We created a new process that makes it significantly easier for customers to recover a password that they can&#x2019;t remember. And we introduced Log In with PayPal, an updated version of PayPal Access that it makes it easier, faster, and safer for consumers to log into the merchants web sites they love and complete their transactions quickly.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&#x2019;m confident that we&#x2019;re in a position to sustain this level of innovation and growth for many quarters to come. So stay tuned, there&#x2019;s a lot more coming as we continue to move forward.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Onward.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Whenever I travel it always strikes me just how global the economy has become. It&#x2019;s amazing how easy it has become to buy American groceries in Tokyo or this season&#x2019;s Parisian fashions in Singapore. Cross border trade is nothing new, but what is a relatively new is a major global phenomena that&#x2019;s growing at a staggering rate and that is people buying and paying directly from businesses half way across the world. Cross-border trade today is about a quarter of PayPal&#x2019;s total payment volume and new shopping corridors are fast emerging. Our data shows that consumers in Argentina, Russia and Israel were among the top five fastest growing export markets (up to 168% year on year growth) for PayPal merchants in the largest markets worldwide last year.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We commissioned Nielsen to conduct a research study on the cross-border shopper in six key markets around the world &#x2013; the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, main land China and Brazil &#x2013; to better understand their behavior and concerns. Just as the traditional spice routes created economic opportunity by connecting consumers and merchants across Europe, Africa and Asia, so too do we think these modern spice routes. It&#x2019;s fascinating to see these new corridors of online trade with consumers shopping directly on overseas websites &#x2013; which can be a new source of growth for today&#x2019;s merchants and bring items from far-flung shores to the homes of people wherever they are.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Aug 28<br><strong style=\"\">David Marcus, President, PayPal</strong><br><br>Last year when I began to lead the team at PayPal, it was clear to me that although we were a strong and thriving company with great promise, our laser-focus on scaling the business, and keeping it compliant in the complex world of payments had taken precedence over our customers&#x2019; experiences for too long.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This was brought home to me in the following months as the media were quick in reacting to the mistakes we were making and we heard in real&#xA0;time&#xA0;from our customers&#xA0;about their issues directly&#xA0;through social media channels. It was clear that something was broken, and it needed to get fixed.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re doing at PayPal to get this stuff fixed:</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>My leadership team committed to making a difference as soon as possible, in the ways that mattered to our customers.&#xA0; The only way to do that with any effect, any impact, was to listen. We spent hours on live calls with our customers at our Customer Service Centers, hearing their challenges and frustrations first-hand. We watched and listened to the feedback we were getting and responded when we could. We asked our friends, cousins and babysitters, suppliers and even strangers what we could do to make PayPal great.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And we never ever, ever lost sight of the fact that we look after people&#x2019;s money &#x2013; we have a great responsibility to keep funds safe and protected from the bad guys &#x2013; no one does this at the scale we do, in the number of countries we operate in, dealing with the number of regulators we have.&#xA0; We know how very, very important and very personal money is to our customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It was time to re-focus and commit in a new way, with a fresh perspective. We worked quickly to fix issues we knew of and could solve for, while at the same time:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">We doubled down on creating beautiful products that leverage our technological leadership</li><li style=\"\">We used a true &#x201C;mobile first&#x201D; approach that shows off our ability to create cut-through UI design to make payments simple</li><li style=\"\">We categorized known &#x201C;pain points&#x201D; so we could check them off and make a real difference in the lives of our customers</li></ul>We call this&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Customer First</strong>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The essence of this initiative is a combined effort across multiple functions in our business to stay focused more than ever on our core audiences of merchants, consumers, and developers, their needs and desires. We genuinely believe that our end-to-end product experience, from the first time you interact with us, to when you call us with a concern or question is who we are &#x2013; it&#x2019;s our community.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Nothing gives us more joy than when a merchant comes online and is able to accept payments and build a business within minutes because of the care we took to make it possible. Nothing gives us more delight than when a busy mom tells us she paid her sitter with PayPal because she didn&#x2019;t have time to stop at the ATM.&#xA0; That&#x2019;s why we do this.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Taking Action</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>We launched a set of initiatives to tackle known customer issues head on. Our teams in Risk Management, Customer Service, Legal and, of course, our Global Product and Technology teams banded together to help solve pain points no matter where you are in the world.&#xA0; We put new procedures in place, used every day by everyone at PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Proudly Use PayPal Every Day</strong>:&#xA0; Employees all over the company &#x2013; from San Jose to Australia &#x2013; use our products every day.&#xA0;&#xA0; We iterate quickly, when our people give us feedback.&#xA0; We tested new products to get our coffee at the office caf&#xE9;, we Order Ahead lunch at our company cafeteria and pay vendors using PayPal. We challenge our employees to be brutal in feedback so we can truly understand what our customer wants and needs. We&#x2019;ve taken that a step further by transforming the look and feel of our offices, starting at our headquarters in San Jose, so we can collaborate quickly and refine our products at the pace required to keep our customers satisfied. No more high walls or siloed spaces &#x2013; we&#x2019;ve literally knocked down the barriers to our workplace to stay nimble and stay connected.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Listening. Hearing. Responding</strong>: Our operations teams are tremendous internal advocates for our customers. They identified a set of complex customer pain points in multiple areas based on internal research and direct feedback from our customers, and I&#x2019;m happy to say that so far&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">we&#x2019;ve solved more than half of these top issues. As a result so far in 2013, we&#x2019;ve tracked 40 million fewer issues that customers have experienced&#xA0;</strong>than last year.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Be The Customer</strong>: Because nothing compares to real conversation, real experiences, and real lives when you&#x2019;re making decisions for your customers, we ask Directors and above to spend a week on the front lines at our call centers to hear and deal with issues first hand. When someone gets promoted, or joins the company at that level, they receive an invitation to go spend a week in one of our centers, and we&#x2019;re relentless in ensuring all of them go. It&#x2019;s a transformational experience that is changing our culture.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Take &#x201C;Risks&#x201D;</strong>: That might sound a little contradictory. Being the leader in online payments makes us a prime target for all the bad guys around the world. Over the years we had to build our industry-leading Risk Management technologies. We&#x2019;ve been able to scale a rate that cannot be replicated by anyone else, and sometimes it&#x2019;s left customers feeling less than satisfied. Of the more than 7.5 million transactions we do every day, the vast majority go through without an issue. We&#x2019;ve tweaked our models to catch more bad guys and way fewer good guys.&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Hundreds of thousands of customers who may have experienced holds last year based on our policies are no longer impacted</strong>&#xA0;and we&#x2019;re seeing some recognition of that work - with a notable increase in our Net Promoter Score, an industry measurement of brand loyalty. We&#x2019;ve also adjusted policies specifically around holds to demonstrate that we trust our customers as much as they trust us. Simply put, we&#x2019;ve built, and are continuing to build a better net. Fewer dolphins, more sharks!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Be Human</strong>: Policies, laws and regulations are black and white. We have to be compliant with government and regulatory agencies, that&#x2019;s just part of doing business as a leader in global payments.&#xA0;But we&#x2019;ve made some tweaks to our policies and procedures and introduced some guiderails to better help you when there are issues. For example, when dealing with alleged counterfeit goods, we now give the benefit of the doubt to the seller while making sure the buyer is not penalized, sometimes taking a loss to ensure a smooth customer experience for everyone involved. For small claims we instituted a &#x201C;no fault construct&#x201D; when there is a buyer complaint so that we now simply absorb this cost. This program benefits tens of thousands of sellers and buyers each month.&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">PayPal will absorb $2.5 million a year</strong>&#xA0;to provide this benefit to our buyers and sellers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Customer First. The PayPal Way.</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;re making a commitment to making PayPal great, and to make it more customer-centric so that people love our products every single day.&#xA0; Now and in the future.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When PayPal launched 15 years ago it fundamentally changed the way commerce is conducted. It literally opened the doors of millions businesses all over the world to millions more consumers in every corner of the globe. And today, there are businesses that simply wouldn&#x2019;t have existed without us. They wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to accept payments online, wouldn&#x2019;t have built innovative businesses unique to the Internet we know today, wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to provide for their families. We take that promise and that legacy very seriously.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We are making huge progress in reinventing the experience for our customers. But we&#x2019;re not quite there yet. We won&#x2019;t be satisfied until all of our customers, consumers, businesses, and developers alike, come away from every interaction with their PayPal with the feeling that we&#x2019;ve helped them in a transparent and valuable way. PayPal should be synonymous with putting the Customer First. That&#x2019;s the PayPal Way.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I will keep you up to date on our progress. We have so much more to share, so much more to do. I look forward to your feedback and comments.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And please be sure to reach out to us when you encounter a problem &#x2013; we&#x2019;re here to fix it!

The&#xA0;<a title=\"new PayPal app\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paying-with-your-phone-has-never-been-so-easy-or-looked-so-good/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">new PayPal app</a>&#xA0;is a great example of how we&#x2019;re helping to solve everyday problems that consumers and merchants struggle with today, even as we deliver exciting new shopping experiences for tomorrow.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Now, instead of finishing a meal at a restaurant by waiting for the server to run your credit card, and then finally return it for your signature, you can simply pay using your PayPal app and leave when you&#x2019;re ready. And, instead of waiting in a line to pick up and pay for your takeout order, you can order ahead through our new app to skip the line altogether.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">But this is just the beginning.</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We challenged ourselves to find a better experience than swiping a credit card. And that&#x2019;s hard. No one wakes up in the morning and thinks, &#x201C;I wish someone invented something better than swiping a card to pay. I hate it.&#x201D; We figured the only better way to pay would be to do nothing. Just walk in a store, and, like magic, when you&#x2019;re ready to pay, money is transferred securely. We played with geo-location leveraging GPS and WiFi. We played with geo-fences in iOS. But, none of these solutions met our standards.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Traditional geo-location requires phone signal and good data throughput to offer a great experience, the indoor resolution isn&#x2019;t good enough, and keeping it on at all times significantly reduces battery life. Geo-fencing can only be used with a limited number of locations.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So, we started looking at Bluetooth Low Energy, otherwise known as BLE. BLE is a breakthrough technology that will enable connected devices to communicate with each other seamlessly, while keeping the energy consumption at a very low level. The team started working on designing an integrated solution that would enable a transaction to take place without having to open up an app, without GPS being turned on, and even without a phone signal for those places with thick concrete walls (those of you who live in the UK know what I mean).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today, I&#x2019;m very excited to unveil PayPal Beacon. This technology is our most significant contribution to date in reinventing the in-store shopping experience. Beacon is a new add-on technology for merchants that will enable consumers to pay at their favorite stores completely hands-free. Consumers will have full control of stores they will want to check in to, those they will want to get prompted to confirm payment for, and stores they will want to enable a complete hands-free experience for. In the latter case, simply walking in a store will trigger a vibration or sound to confirm a successful check in (this happens in milliseconds), your photo will then appear on the screen of the Point-of-Sale system so you can be greeted by name. Paying only requires a verbal confirmation, and you&#x2019;re done. No wallet. No card. Nothing to do. Not even touching your phone.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Any store running&#xA0;<a title=\"Point-of-Sale systems\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-cash-for-registers\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Point-of-Sale systems</a>&#xA0;compatible with PayPal, including Booker, Erply, Leaf, Leapset, Micros, NCR, PayPal Here, Revel, ShopKeep, TouchBistro and Vend, and many more soon, will simply plug a PayPal Beacon device in a power outlet in their store. Once the Beacon is plugged in, they will be ready to offer the best, most personal shopping experience ever.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We value our customers&#x2019; privacy, so PayPal Beacon won&#x2019;t constantly track your location like other technologies. If you enter a store and decline to check in, or just ignore the prompt entirely, no information is transmitted to PayPal or the merchant.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">We&#x2019;re opening up opportunities for retailers and developers.</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With the introduction of PayPal Beacon, I believe we&#x2019;re opening the door to a fundamentally different way to use technology to make shopping richer and more valuable for consumers and merchants alike. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m excited to share the news that we&#x2019;re giving developers access to the PayPal mobile in-store API to create experiences such as being able to self-checkout on your mobile phone or automatically placing a customer&#x2019;s usual order as soon as they walk through the door. Take a look at the videos below to see how it works and to get inspired. Developers can submit their ideas at&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/beacon\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">www.paypal.com/beacon</a>&#xA0;for a chance to be chosen as one of the 100 developers that get access to the API and a free developer version of the PayPal Beacon device before we roll this out.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ll start piloting Beacon-enabled shopping experiences in Q4, and the full rollout is planned early next year.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I, for one, can&#x2019;t wait to see what developers do with PayPal Beacon once they get their hands on it. For a chance to be chosen as one of the developers to experiment with PayPal&#x2019;s mobile in-store API and the PayPal Beacon device, just visit&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/beacon\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">www.paypal.com/beacon</a>&#xA0;to submit your ideas. This is also the place to go for anyone who is interested in learning more about this great new technology, or signing up to receive updates on when it will be available to everyone.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The future of in-store payments is finally here.

Of course, because we&#x2019;re PayPal, paying with your phone doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to give up choice. We have made it even easier to pay using your bank account in one store and your credit card at the next place. In this release, you can even open a line of credit in the app using&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.billmelater.com/cm/paypal/landers/13ppbmlACQappfin.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Bill Me Later</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ve also vastly improved the in-store shopping experience.

Great food and some fun perks kept everyone focused, but when the developers weren&apos;t coding, conversations quickly moved to how they believe our society will soon become cardless as part of their effort to create an app to solve a local issue.<span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x2028;&#x2028;Amid tough competition the winning Miami team, which consisted of Alexander Sj&#xF6;gren, Jose Pimienta and Osniel Gonzalez for Team Yellow Pepper, designed an app to help resolve a huge local Miami problem: a lack of ATMs. The app helps consumers find places to withdraw small amounts of cash at a low cost through any PayPal merchant that integrates their API.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Consumers can pick up the cash at a shop, a home, or just about anywhere.

        "title": "Closed Loop Offers Save Money for Consumers and Drive Commerce for Merchants",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Sep 06<br><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Patrick Gauthier, Head of Emerging Retail Services, PayPal</span></strong><br><br><br>When we look at new technology at PayPal we&#x2019;re interested in one thing: does it actually solve a problem for either a consumer or a business? We&#x2019;re not interested in technology for technology&#x2019;s sake, but rather those solutions that drive more sales and customers for merchants and save time and money for consumers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When we looked at the current state of &#x201C;offers&#x201D; we saw a lot of problems. Many consumers equate offers with spam&#x2014;they&#x2019;re not easy to redeem, and often people simply just forget to bring them along when they&#x2019;re actually going to a store. As a consequence, offers perform unevenly for merchants. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re so excited to share a fantastic new feature called a Closed Loop Offer (CLO) that will change the way people shop and buy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Closed Loop Offers by PayPal, are simply smarter offers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Closed Loop Offers are smarter for merchants accepting PayPal, in how they enable them to put real money into a PayPal user&#x2019;s account to be spent at their sites and stores. Offers are distributed through digital media placements (online, email, mobile) or placed directly into the user&#x2019;s PayPal account. Redemption can be omni-channel (e.g. both in-store and online to provide flexibility and choice to the consumer) or designed to drive sales in one particular channel. CLOs can be targeted based on a number of criteria, including PayPal&#x2019;s proprietary segmentation models, or by channel, geography, and day parts. Better still, the merchant doesn&#x2019;t need to change anything about their marketing or payment infrastructure. And once a CLO campaign is complete, full funnel metrics from ad impressions to the transaction-enabling measurement of return on investment are provided to the merchant. In short, Closed Loop Offers give merchants and brands a treasure trove of options to reach PayPal&#x2019;s 55 million US customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Closed Loop Offers are also smarter for consumers because they are relevant. These offers, they can actually use. They&#x2019;re smarter offers because once they&#x2019;re saved into a PayPal wallet, the consumer can forget about them. They&#x2019;ll be alerted when the offer is about to expire and the discount is automatically applied at the time of purchase, not as a statement of credit weeks later.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Simply put, CLOs enable consumers to get offers they will care about and merchants to get pre-qualified prospects. When you combine this capability with that of the PayPal Media Network, including geo-fencing and context targeting, the result is connecting consumers and merchants in a personal and effective way that drives engagement, loyalty and sales. This is the power of Connected Commerce.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal has a rich history of solving commerce challenges&#x2014;beginning with pioneering a secure online payment platform, for example, and more recently, by taking the pain out of settling the bill at a restaurant with&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paying-with-your-phone-has-never-been-so-easy-or-looked-so-good/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">view, tip, and pay technology</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>An easier and better shopping experience for both customers and merchants is what we&#x2019;re after. Closed Loop Offers provide retailers with an effective tool to acquire and connect with customers on a whole new level, as well as drive repeat patronage of those same customers. And they&#x2019;ll give shoppers the savings they want while avoiding offer clutter and wasting valuable time.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For more information on Closed Loop Offers, visit:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://advertising.paypal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">http://advertising.paypal.com</a><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

However, there are unique regulatory and risk aspects inherent to this new way to raise money from supporters around the world. To name one, we sometimes hear from campaign contributors that they are confused about what exactly their money is going towards, and assume that they&#x2019;ll get it back if the venture is not successful.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Because the model is so new, it is potentially open to abuse. PayPal has a responsibility to ensure that the system remains secure, in compliance with Government regulations around the world, and that consumers who contribute to these campaigns understand where their money is going.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Some of PayPal&apos;s competitors solve this by simply refusing to allow their payment systems to be used at all for crowdfunding. We don&apos;t believe that&apos;s the right approach because, when done right, crowdfunding is a powerful catalyst for innovation. However, it&apos;s clear that our existing policies and processes aren&#x2019;t working quite right for this particular fundraising model.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We are now in the midst of overhauling our policies in this space. We&apos;re talking to the major crowdfunding players that we work with to put in place a permanent solution that avoids unnecessary account limitations. But making this work for all stakeholders &#x2013; contributors, entrepreneurs, crowdfunding sites and us -- is pretty complicated. As soon as I have more to share, I promise to update everyone.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the meantime, we will ensure that each crowdfunding campaign is reviewed by a senior member of my team before any action is taken. It&#x2019;s a small, but important step.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal&apos;s very essence is connecting buyers and sellers. The last thing we want to do is get in the way of the innovative new products coming from entrepreneurs raising money via crowdfunding.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We never forget that we are looking after other people&apos;s money. The customer-first approach is the essence of what our president David Marcus wrote in a&#xA0;<a title=\"recent post\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/customer-first-the-paypal-way/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">recent post</a>&#xA0;to this blog, and we have a responsibility to keep funds safe and protected. No one does this at the scale we do, in the number of countries we operate in, and with the number of regulators we have.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&apos;re making changes every day to get this right, but if anyone is having an outstanding issue with PayPal for a crowdfunding effort, here is my direct email:&#xA0;<a title=\"tbarel@paypal.com\" href=\"mailto:tbarel@paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">tbarel@paypal.com</a>.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Thank you,&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Tomer Barel&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>VP Risk Management, PayPal<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

After a life of body sculpting competitions, TV presenting, triathlons and even Moto-x racing, Natalie made a sharp turn towards the world of entrepreneurship and has since built her career with a combination of modern business savvy and a serious sense of adventure.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As a triple citizen with a never-ending case of wanderlust, she operates almost entirely from the road, demonstrating both a brave new world of possibilities and the power of today&#x2019;s tools. Naturally, we were delighted to learn that she chose PayPal to manage the financial end of her initiatives.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The story of her online business journey can be found in her new book,&#xA0;<a title=\"The Suitcase Entrepreneur\" href=\"http://suitcaseentrepreneur.com/book/#sthash.tp9IfpuM.dpbs\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">The Suitcase Entrepreneur</a>, and we were lucky enough to be able to speak with her about why PayPal remains the best option for those looking to follow in her footsteps.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Why did you choose PayPal over other options, such as Google Checkout and Amazon Payments?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When I left New Zealand to travel the world I realized I needed an online payment solution where I could send and receive money in a large number of currencies without having to worry about bank charges or international complexities. PayPal spoke to every concern I had at the time about how to manage my finances, and when I started my online business it seemed like the most obvious solution to be able to charge in one currency for my products and services and receive funds from almost anywhere around the world. I also liked that I could clearly see all transactions online and manage my finances, as well as the level of fees I was accountable for. Plus PayPal was the most widely accepted form of payment solution online.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I became particularly enamoured when I cofounded my first technology company and we built our&#xA0;<a title=\"FundRazr app\" href=\"https://fundrazr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">FundRazr app</a>&#xA0;on Facebook on top of the PayPal app. This is when I started to really get a better understanding of what PayPal offered.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Would all of that still apply if you started your business today rather than years ago?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>I think there are a lot more choices nowadays in terms of payment platforms but for me personally I&#x2019;ve still not found a solution that works in with my personal situation so well. As someone with multiple citizenships and bank accounts I still find PayPal is the most universal payments platform I can use.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Further, merchant accounts can take a ton of work to set up and a lot of paperwork, but my PayPal Pro Flow account gives me the same flexibility as a merchant account. What&#x2019;s more is that people trust PayPal and it&#x2019;s far more likely they have a PayPal account to use so I can naturally work with a broader range of international clients and customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Most of my vendors these days invoice me via PayPal and I pay my team via PayPal too. It&#x2019;s my global online bank.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What do you think it is about PayPal that is specifically appealing to entrepreneurs today?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I think it&#x2019;s the fact that you can access PayPal online, through your mobile device and have so much functionality at your fingertips. I can literally run my entire business with a website and a PayPal button.

By being physically present and having people to explain your products and services it makes you real and tangible. It allows people to interact with your solutions in an environment where they can touch, see and feel you first, and then carry on that goodwill and experience to the online environment with a greater understanding of what you do and why that matters.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">As an entrepreneur working with a number of inexpensive tools, which PayPal integrations have you found to be most helpful?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For me I saw the added value when I started to notice that PayPal was widely accepted and integrated with many of the online tools and software programs I was using including e-Junkie, WordPress and oDesk.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That felt incredibly liberating as it meant I could run my business seamlessly with my PayPal account and not to have set up a new way to get paid each time.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When I switched to a business account I immediately started using the increased functionality like subscriptions and recurring payments, which expanded my business offerings even further. I use these more than any other functionality within PayPal.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What has surprised you the most about PayPal&#x2019;s offerings?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I was surprised to find that PayPal offered a merchant account setup when I was investigating how to get one. I guess I always saw PayPal as the easiest way to send and receive money online, not as a fully-fledged solution.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Any last words for entrepreneurs considering their payment options?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At the end of the day you have to choose the payment solution that&apos;s going to fit your local and global needs.

That&#x2019;s why we chose New Jersey-based &#x201C;Cake Boss&#x201D; star Buddy Valastro to collaborate with for our Cash for Registers program -- as a baker, entrepreneur, reality TV star and father of four, Buddy is a living, breathing example of what it takes to make it as a small business owner.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">&#x201C;The trick to being successful is that you need to focus 100 percent of yourself on whatever you are doing,&#x201D; he explained. &#x201C;You need to be the miracle man and make it all happen--it&#x2019;s what separates entrepreneurs from regular people.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">PayPal Killed the Cash Register</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Our Cash for Registers program fed directly into that mentality by replacing Buddy&#x2019;s traditional register with a Point-of-Sale system from ShopKeep POS for managing his payments. With ShopKeepPOS powered by PayPal, SMBs can accept virtually any type of payment, automatically making goods and services accessible to consumers, no matter their preference.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">&#x201C;For me, it&#x2019;s very important to have a system that you don&#x2019;t need to worry about &#x2018;cause, at the end of the day, I got cakes to make!&#x201D;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">The team at Carlo&apos;s Bakery even created a custom PayPal cash register cake with an ax through it to show their enthusiasm:&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Sweet Surprise and Delight&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Buddy also took his energy and our initiative to the road by surprising a few SMB friends in the NYC food industry, including Smush, Telegraphe Caf&#xE9; and Donut Pub, an old-school bakery favorite in Chelsea that Buddy gifted with a PayPal hardware bundle.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">After the surprise visits, he and his team went to the eBay Inc. Commerce Innovation Center and had lunch with 18 PayPal merchants ranging from food cart vendors to storefront shopkeepers. The family-style meal was perfect for engaging conversation, and Buddy used the opportunity to share his knowledge and advice on small business.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Of course, he saved the best sharing for last, which was the custom cash register cake! Check it all out in the video below:&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\">Follow the Boss</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Our Cash for Registers program with Buddy could not have been a more positive or validating experience.

From every day purchases to special high ticket items, we&#x2019;re delighted to have these merchants as our launch partners. Take a look:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Online hypermarkets, Ozon.ru and Enter.ru</li><li style=\"\">Designer furniture and accessories from Westwing</li><li style=\"\">Travel from Tutu.ru and Anywayanyday.ru</li><li style=\"\">Russia&apos;s largest online store for clothes, shoes and accessories inLaModa.ru</li><li style=\"\">Fashion from MyWalit.ru</li><li style=\"\">Food delivery from Utkonos.ru</li><li style=\"\">Kitchen appliances from Holodilnuik.ru</li><li style=\"\">Cellphone and consumer electronics with Svyaznoy</li><li style=\"\">Emex.ru sells auto goods and parts</li><li style=\"\">Biglion, the leader in coupons, providing discounts for many great services</li><li style=\"\">KupiVip provides 90% discounts on online shopping.&#xA0;</li></ul>This is a major milestone in our efforts to bring the security and convenience of PayPal to one of the world&#x2019;s fastest growing ecommerce markets.<br><br>According to a study by McKinsey &amp; Company, there were 70 million people online in Russia in 2012, already the largest online community in Europe and growing at 35% each year. They also report people in Russia made $13bn in online purchases in 2011, which is expected to grow to $25bn by 2014.<br><br>The Russian people are eager to shop online.

In a society dominated by cash we are excited to solve some of the friction points in paying online for the things you want.<br><br>It has been possible to open a PayPal account in Russia for a few years, but only to pay in US dollars. Despite that, three million people in Russia have registered for an account and over one million are using PayPal actively.

The more people in Russia that used PayPal, the more we kept hearing they wanted to be able to pay in rubles.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Sep 17<br><strong style=\"\">Clam Lorenz, Director, Nonprofit Engagement, PayPal</strong><br><br><span style=\"\">Pencils of Promise is a non-profit organization that works diligently to increase educational opportunities in the developing world. Recently, I sat down with Carlo Dumandan, the org&#x2019;s Digital Media Manager, to discuss these efforts and how PayPal helps along the way.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Tell us a little about Pencils of Promise.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Pencils of Promise started a little under 5 years ago with $25 and a dream. Our CEO &amp; Founder, Adam Braun, started with an initial goal of just building one school to dedicate to his grandmother. Since then, we&#x2019;ve built over 150 schools in Laos, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Ghana, and are implementing educational programs such student progression scholarships, lessons on sanitation &amp; hygiene and teacher training to provide quality education to our students as well.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">What makes Pencils of Promise unique?&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">One thing that is incredibly important to us is dedication from the communities in which we work. We require that they contribute at least 10-20% of the build and it usually comes in the form of labor or materials. We work with communities that truly want a school for their children. In Ghana, for example, PoP school builds have 4x the number of volunteers participating in the construction process than is mandated.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Our business model is based on for-profit business acumen and non-profit ideals, which is different from most in the space. We&#x2019;re a nonprofit with a true focus on efficiency and data measurement - we have an entire department and system dedicated to measuring the effectiveness of our work. The quality of our programs we deliver on the ground is a lot more important to us than increasing our school count.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">What are some of your biggest challenges in getting support?&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">Since we are working in the developing world, many of our supporters don&#x2019;t get to experience the impact they helped create first-hand which is why social media is incredibly important to us. Social media helps us bridge this gap and allow us to share photos, videos, and stories of the impact we are collectively creating as a global community.</span><br><br><span style=\"\">How does Pencils of Promise currently use PayPal and why did you choose us over other payment platforms?&#xA0;<br></span><br><span style=\"\">We use PayPal as our main payment processor for our donations page on our website PencilsofPromise.org. For any company transacting payments online, security is key. PayPal is a trusted payment processor with relatively low processing fees, which is a major win for any nonprofit.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">How can others get involved in Pencils of Promise&#x2019;s cause?<br></span><br><span style=\"\">We actually just launched our Back to School campaign on August 13th. Through this campaign, we hope to raise $500,000 to fund 5,000 student scholarships, which will allow primary school students to progress to secondary school. In our partner communities, about half of students don&#x2019;t have what they need to progress forward in their education. A PoP scholarship covers all the basic necessities in order to make a seamless transition to secondary school: school fees, a backpack and supplies, and a uniform.</span><br><br><span style=\"\">This initiative is super exciting for us because these scholarships are awarded to students who are working hard in school and truly deserve them.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\">You can find out more at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://pencilsofpromise.org/backtoschool\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">http://pencilsofpromise.org/backtoschool</a></span><br><br><span style=\"\">Would you recommend PayPal to another nonprofit? Why?&#xA0;<br></span><br><span style=\"\">Yes, definitely. PayPal has a wonderful customer support team and integrates seamlessly with our CRM, Salesforce. We&#x2019;ve never had an issue with your service!</span><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

Many need additional capital to grow or sell more so they can better compete and succeed, but it&#x2019;s no secret in the small business community that securing capital is difficult. According to&#xA0;<a title=\"a report\" href=\"http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2013/2013-10.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">a report</a>&#xA0;released in August by The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the total value of small business loans in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 78 percent less than in the second quarter in 2007.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today we are pleased to share PayPal Working Capital, an innovative way for PayPal customers to fund their growing businesses. For the first time, select PayPal businesses will have access to a business loan that allows them to get funding in minutes once they apply, review and agree to terms. And it allows them to repay with a share of their sales and know they&#x2019;re paying for the loan with one, affordable fixed fee. From September 24 through December 31, 2013 select PayPal businesses in the United States will be offered an exclusive release of PayPal Working Capital, which is issued by the lender, WebBank.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal Working Capital is available to select businesses that already process payments with PayPal. And it&#x2019;s simple:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">It&#x2019;s a business loan that enables PayPal merchants to repay the loan with a share of their PayPal sales, so there are no minimum monthly payments. If you have no sales on a particular day, you owe no payments for that day.<br><br></li><li style=\"\">Select PayPal merchants can apply online, review and agree to the terms of the business loan and if approved, get funding into their PayPal account in minutes.<br><br></li><li style=\"\">Pricing is simple and clear. The loan is available for a single, fixed fee that is displayed to a business before signing up. There are no periodic interest charges, late fees, pre-payment fees, or any other fees, so a merchant knows what they&#x2019;ll pay, down to the penny.<br><br></li><li style=\"\">Under the PayPal Working Capital program, the lender uses PayPal sales history to extend credit, so no credit check is required and the loan does not affect a business&#x2019;s credit score.</li></ul>PayPal&#x2019;s strategy is focused on providing simple access to funding for small businesses, and we have a strong relationship with our business customers. The lender WebBank will make credit decisions based on our customers&#x2019; PayPal sales history. Decision-making and funding loans will be faster than alternative sources would be and, more importantly, the loan offers greater degrees of flexibility and transparency.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We are constantly listening to and engaging with small businesses so we can help them solve problems and sell more. PayPal reached out to the SMB community including a survey of 1,000 PayPal small businesses who conveyed their frustration with the current lending system and the need for more options. This is how PayPal Working Capital was born.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal Working Capital enables small businesses to easily scale to meet seasonal demands, and seize new business opportunities when they arise. For example, PayPal merchants can easily access funds they need to expand inventory and increase their staffs to gear up for busy times such as the fast-approaching holiday season.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal has been committed to small businesses since we pioneered online shopping nearly 15 years ago and helped to open the doors of millions of businesses worldwide. PayPal Working Capital is an extension of this commitment and one we&#x2019;re extremely proud to introduce.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

We are Canadian and it was a great way to show my three boys their amazing country. But, as you probably know &#x2013; Canada is BIG &#x2013; which means a lot of time in the car.

The story behind why your business exists, who you are as a business owner, how you first came up with your product idea, the lessons you&#x2019;ve learned along the way and what you do to delight your customers every day are great stories and can be powerful marketing tools. At their heart, great stories are about connecting the writer and the reader emotionally &#x2013; and small business owners know that creating an emotional connection with their customers can be a great competitive advantage.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Small business owners today have more ways than ever to tell their stories to customers. Social media has given them that perfect podium, which is both affordable and has broad reach.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The Story of Caplansky&apos;s Deli</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A great example of an entrepreneur who has built his company successfully with storytelling is Zane Caplansky, owner of Caplansky&#x2019;s Deli in Toronto. Zane&#x2019;s business started 5 years ago with a craving for a great sandwich and is now an incredibly successful Jewish deli brand including a bustling downtown restaurant, food truck, catering business and a soon-to-launch packaged goods line selling in grocery stores across the country.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;My dream was to bring great Jewish deli food back to Toronto,&#x201D; he said. I started making the Jewish handmade, homemade food that that my grandmother Thelma made for me.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Part of the reason that Zane was able to turn his dream into a reality is that he told his story to everyone who would listen and through all the tools at his disposal &#x2013; Twitter, Facebook and his blog. He even put his personal email address on the restaurant&#x2019;s menus to start personal conversations with his customers about Jewish food and their experiences in his restaurant. It worked.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;On social media [platforms] and when I talk to customers I&#x2019;m always saying that I love food and believe in its power to bring people together and help them celebrate the special moments in their lives. I believe great food builds strong communities. Whether I&#x2019;m promoting a contest between grandmothers to see who can make the best matzoh ball or hosting a traditional Jewish dinner at the restaurant for people who have never tried Jewish food &#x2013; I&#x2019;m telling my story about food and people coming together. This is why people say they feel a connection with my business and why my business has grown. Of course, the food is amazing too.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Beyond social media, Zane has also been featured in the press on many occasions and appeared in numerous reality television shows about his business and his passion for food. He&#x2019;s even been the star of a PayPal video about his business.

As it turns out, it felt almost like magic when my sales reached all over the globe.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today Yang has a total of three parallel online sales platforms consisting of his CHOCOLAZI&#x2122; official website for wholesale,&#xA0;<a title=\"an eBay store\" href=\"http://stores.ebay.com.au/chocolazistore\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">an eBay store</a>&#xA0;for retail, and a newly-opened customized product line store called&#xA0;<a title=\"Pipapa\" href=\"http://www.pipapa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Pipapa</a>. Opposite to the common offline-to-online trend, he used PayPal to start with online business and then developed considerable offline big deals with some of his online customers.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Sep 20<br><strong style=\"\">Jennifer Hakes , Director, Corporate Communications, PayPal</strong><br><br>When I started working at PayPal just about three years ago, I have to admit, I wasn&apos;t what they would call a &quot;power user.&quot; Sure, I was extremely familiar with the brand, I trusted it as a form of payments online and when I said that I was going to work for PayPal, people were impressed and excited.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But over my time here, I&apos;ve become a true believer &#x2013; and not just because they sign my paycheck. Because I had a moment.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Navigating Convenience</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>One of the challenges my colleagues and I find when trying to communicate the value of PayPal to our consumers is that there are SO many everyday features an average consumer could use: you can split the check with friends from the PayPal mobile app (there&apos;s a new one &#x2013;&#xA0;<a title=\"check it out\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paying-with-your-phone-has-never-been-so-easy-or-looked-so-good/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">check it out</a>!), pay your babysitter with a credit card using PayPal Here, or pay back your mom for that group gift for dad. You can do this from your desk, your phone, or on the beach. The possibilities and potential for making your life easier are literally limitless, making tough to pick just one to demonstrate value.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So I started asking my friends and family the same question: &#x201C;What was your PayPal Moment?&#x201D; They initially stared back at me blankly, but once I clarified &#x2013; &#x201C;What was the moment where you realized that PayPal made your life better, easier and you didn&apos;t want to live without it?&quot; &#x2013; the light bulb turned on and people got excited. And they each had a different answer.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>My dad: &quot;I&apos;ve been eyeing that computer for your mom for too long, so I bit the bullet and used BillMeLater. It was so easy &#x2013; maybe too easy. Now I&apos;m looking for my next big online purchase!&quot;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>My mom: &quot;Oh, honey, you know I use PayPal several times a week to keep up with my eBay addiction. Please call me more often.&quot;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>My best friend: &quot;I paid most of my wedding vendors with PayPal and it was awesome.&quot;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Lonely Carts</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>My own moment was similar in simplicity and I feel very common, but nonetheless transformative.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I was on the couch after a long day at the office (insert tiny violin here) surfing on my iPad. I&#x2019;d just discovered a new site for furniture, d&#xE9;cor and travel accessories, and was obsessing over a certain clock. As I started to make the purchase, I realized they didn&apos;t take PayPal. The couch was so comfortable I didn&#x2019;t want to get up and get my credit card, so I abandoned the cart.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I still think about that clock, but I&apos;ve never looked back. Nowadays, comfy couch or no comfy couch, I don&#x2019;t pay for anything online unless PayPal is accepted.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It will continue to be a challenge to tell consumers why they should use PayPal every day in multiple ways, but to me that&apos;s a good problem to have. Every second is a new opportunity to prove that our platform can be what you want when you need it &#x2013; secure, flexible, easy to use and transformative. Just give yourself a moment to discover why.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>However, I just realized that my PayPal Moment just revealed me as a total sloth. I need to hit the gym.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>What was your PayPal Moment?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Sep 26<br><strong style=\"\">David Marcus, President, PayPal</strong><br>I came to PayPal and eBay Inc. in 2011 via the acquisition of Zong because it offered the best opportunity to achieve the goal I&#x2019;ve been working toward for more than 15 years: to use the power of digital technology to transform the world of payments. I&#x2019;ve always believed that if we can make transactions safer and easier, we&#x2019;ll unlock value and convenience that we can only imagine today.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Over the past year and a half, we&#x2019;ve worked hard at PayPal to put this idea into practice. We&#x2019;re delivering beautiful products that make shopping faster, simpler, and more fun. We&#x2019;re introducing innovative technologies that enable businesses to thrive in an increasingly mobile world. We&#x2019;re providing tools to help developers create compelling new experiences that connect merchants with their customers in entirely new ways.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A lot of other companies claim they&#x2019;re doing these things, too. But in the crowded payments space, most have a long way to go before they actually deliver useful solutions at the scale that&#x2019;s required.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>One company delivering these solutions today is Braintree. In a very short time, Braintree has built impressive mobile payment solutions that handle transactions in 130 currencies in more than 40 countries. Mobile developers love Braintree&#x2019;s tools and the great hands-on service that they offer.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I admire Braintree because they were one of the very first companies to understand the power of real mobile-first experiences. I&#x2019;m not talking about traditional e-commerce ported to your mobile device. I&#x2019;m talking about groundbreaking experiences offered by companies like Airbnb, OpenTable, Uber, and TaskRabbit. Light, powerful, massively disruptive, and thoroughly delightful, they are all powered by Braintree.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today&#x2019;s news that we have agreed to acquire Braintree is a great move for both companies.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As a separate service offered by PayPal, Braintree will be able to scale its platform at a rate that is just not possible for a startup. PayPal&#x2019;s already solved many of the regulatory and logistical hurdles that will help to extend Braintree&#x2019;s reach to more customers in more markets even faster. Our resources will enable them to push the boundaries of innovation with ambition and confidence for consumers, merchants and developers around the world. It&#x2019;s business as usual for Braintree. Braintree will continue to maintain its best-in-class service for its customers and developers for the foreseeable future.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And with the addition of Braintree, PayPal gets a lot more than a notable list of clients and an impressive technology portfolio. Today&#x2019;s news means that Braintree&#x2019;s team of brilliant engineers, innovative mobile strategists, and strong business leaders will soon be joining our ranks. Led by Bill Ready, they&#x2019;ve built a company culture that emphasizes initiative, ownership, and passion for quality. Bill is an experienced entrepreneur and payment industry veteran who achieved great success at iPay Technologies and Netzee Payments before taking over as CEO of Braintree in 2011. I&#x2019;m looking forward to having him join my executive team.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The real winners today are consumers, who can expect to soon enjoy easier, safer, faster, and more innovative ways to pay on more of their favorite apps and at their favorite businesses. Together, I believe PayPal and Braintree will enable merchants and developers to create new mobile experiences that are magical in ways that we can&#x2019;t even begin to picture today.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Bill and I share a common vision of payments built around friction-free, mobile-first experiences and disruptive businesses that surprise and delight customers at every turn. By joining forces, we expect to realize this vision at unprecedented scale and unmatchable speed.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>David&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

I hit the pavement along with colleague Melanie Kriese for a first-hand look at the consumer experience, including what people were saying about our integrations.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Constructed in the heart of the main concert area, our Convenience Store served as a focal point for engagement. We saw lots of people using the PayPal app to check in for 50% off essentials like sunscreen, ear plugs and blankets, as well as to participate in activities such as face painting, hair chalking, temporary tattoos of the day&#x2019;s lineup, and pictures at the Instagram photo booth. All of the profits from PayPal Convenience Store sales went to support the non-profit&#xA0;<a title=\"San Francisco Rock Project\" href=\"http://www.rockprojectsf.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">San Francisco Rock Project</a>, which provides a performing arts education for kids 7-18 years old.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We used the PayPal app to check in as we walked up to the store. We got to the counter, said hi, the clerk tapped our photo on his iPad, and we were done! No cash, no card, no angst. Plus, we walked away with some sweet PayPal-blue fuzzy gloves. Yes, gloves! It can get chilly in San Francisco, even in August.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>One concertgoer had just installed her PayPal app that morning. A PayPal staff member at the Convenience Store showed her how to use it and then added, &#x201C;Now, no wallet. No credit card.&#x201D; Her response? An enthusiastic, &#x201C;OMG! I LOVE that!&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The mobile phone charging stations were also a huge hit, making the Convenience Store the place to chill out and recharge between shows.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Next we were off to find San Francisco&#x2019;s famous food trucks, which were well represented this year and all accepted PayPal! But what to choose? Buttermilk fried chicken? Pizza? Ribs? Spring rolls? Tacos? Finally, a grilled cheese and bacon sandwich from&#xA0;<a title=\"Bacon Bacon\" href=\"http://www.baconbaconsf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Bacon Bacon</a>&#xA0;was the decided winner. We logged in to our PayPal app, tapped &#x2018;Local&#x2019; and checked in before saying &#x201C;I&#x2019;m paying with PayPal.&#x201D; And that was it &#x2013; our cashier didn&#x2019;t have to deal with a card or cash. More importantly, neither did we.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The experience? Super easy. The sandwich? Well, it was melted cheese, and toasted bread, and bacon. Fabulous, of course!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We also stopped in at several non-food merchants, all of which were sporting the familiar blue PayPal Here dongle on their iPads.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Finally, a quick stroll around the outside of the main festival area revealed hundreds of blue lockers powered by PayPal, which were so popular they sold out! Why not lock up your wallet if you don&#x2019;t need it for anything, right?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For even the casual festivalgoer, PayPal&#x2019;s presence at Outside Lands was hard to miss. And for those who chilled out, charged up, or used PayPal to pay, it appeared to be something more: a seamless, simple, delightful part of life.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "title": "Tower Paddle Boards Rides Wave of Success, with Help from PayPal",
        "publishDate": "2015-05-26T07:00:00.000Z",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Oct 14<br><strong style=\"\">PayPal, an eBay company</strong><br><br>Stephan Aarstol spends a lot of time around sharks. An avid paddle boarder, he rides waves alongside leopard sharks in the waters off La Jolla, California. And as the owner of e-commerce startup Tower Paddle Boards, he communes with another kind of shark: Mark Cuban, American business magnate and investor &#x201C;shark&#x201D; on the ABC television series, &#x201C;Shark Tank.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Aarstol&#x2019;s deep dive into the paddle boards market was unplanned. The entrepreneur and Internet marketing expert was working to launch another startup in 2010 when a friend invited him paddle boarding. Aarstol was instantly hooked. &#x201C;On my first day, I was catching waves left and right,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t believe how easy it was. I sensed a huge market for paddle boards was ready to blow up.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>San Diego-based&#xA0;<a title=\"Tower Paddle Boards\" href=\"http://www.towerpaddleboards.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Tower Paddle Boards</a>&#xA0;sells direct to consumers online, a new concept for the space. (Traditional retailers use tiered distribution channels, which increases product cost.) Tower Paddle Boards also introduced a new product design to the market &#x2013; a paddle board that&#x2019;s shorter, wider, and thicker than typical 12-foot boards.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Since Aarstol appeared on &#x201C;Shark Tank&#x201D; in 2012 and scored a US $150,000 investment from Cuban, Tower Paddle Boards has been on a growth track. Aarstol says offering PayPal as a payment option to customers also has contributed to the startup&#x2019;s impressive growth in sales from $3,000 to nearly $3 million in less than three years. &#x201C;In my opinion, PayPal is something any legitimate e-commerce company must offer,&#x201D; says Aarstol.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Bill Me Later&#xAE; from PayPal is popular with Aarstol&#x2019;s customers. The average price of a Tower Paddle Board is $795 plus shipping costs. Comparable boards from competitors sell for $1,200 and up. But even at a lower price, a Tower Paddle Board is a big investment for many consumers. That&#x2019;s why Aarstol believes Bill Me Later is a deciding factor in many Tower Paddle Board purchases. To let customers know they have more time to pay, Aarstol added Bill Me Later banners to Tower Paddle Boards&#x2019; home page and product pages. He says placing the banners and adding PayPal as a payment option took just 15 minutes.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is creating other advantages for Tower Paddle Boards. &#x201C;PayPal&#x2019;s rates are much lower than what we pay for credit card processing today,&#x201D; says Aarstol. And since the company integrated PayPal Express Checkout with its Volusion e-commerce platform, order processing has become more efficient. &#x201C;Now, every PayPal order is funded immediately,&#x201D; says Aarstol.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Paddle boarding isn&#x2019;t a hot trend outside the United States yet. But Aarstol is betting it will be soon. When that happens, he says PayPal can help the company win business: &#x201C;Unlike most U.S. consumers, people in other countries don&#x2019;t have a credit card. But anyone with a bank account can use PayPal.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Aarstol&#x2019;s next focus is building a state-of-the-art, 5,000-square-foot production facility for Tower Paddle Boards in San Diego. And by combining the company&#x2019;s warehousing, shipping and production operations in one space, he is able to do so at very little cost. &#x201C;Essentially, we got a factory with virtually no overhead,&#x201D; Aarstol says. &#x201C;By leveraging our e-commerce infrastructure, we&#x2019;re able to bring manufacturing back to the United States, and PayPal has played a part in this.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Attending their first hackathon, four Georgetown University students took home first place with PhilanthroFeed. PhilanthroFeed enables people to help feed the homeless. Nowadays, many people don&#x2019;t carry cash around or want to ensure that the money they donate is being used for the food it was intended for. Through the app, the homeless person would create a profile via a social worker, or anyone else with Internet access. When someone wants to donate, they find the homeless person&#x2019;s profile in the app, then donate to add a credit for their account. The homeless person would then go to a participating restaurant and redeem the money for a meal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Some of the other unique applications developed at the event included BosWash and Fund B.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>BosWash, an application that uses crowd funding to help improve D.C. parks or other public spaces, took second place. BosWash users place a bounty on an improvement task (i.e. clean up the trash at a local playground), and other people can take on the task and redeem the bounty through the application once it&#x2019;s been completed. In third place, was Fund B, an application created as an alternative to PayDay loans, which typically have high interest rates. Fund B instead allows groups of Facebook friends to fund small loans to one another other in exchange for a small fee.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Battle Hack London</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While I wasn&#x2019;t in London, I heard they had a great turnout.

Taking it a step further, the subscription based service, would also alert your designated contacts if you deviate from that path.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In second place was Bigger Issue, an application allows you to buy a copy of the Big Issue Magazine using text messages and PayPal. Big Issue Magazine was launched in 1991 in response to the growing homeless population London. The Magazine works to address the problem of homelessness by offering homeless people the opportunity to earn a legitimate income as a Big Issue vendor.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Neighbour.ly, an application that allows users to define your neighborhood and then lend household items to others within your local community, came in third.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Two Continents.

The six weeks between Labor Day and Columbus Day might have been the busiest in PayPal&#x2019;s fifteen-year history. As I look back at this thrilling &#x2013; and maybe a little crazy time &#x2013; I&#x2019;m struck by our pace of innovation. And delighted that we&#x2019;re showing no signs of slowing down.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>David mentioned some of these in his post yesterday but there&#x2019;s so much more&#x2026;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">In Store</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>On September 5, we launched an&#xA0;<a title=\"entirely revamped consumer app\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paying-with-your-phone-has-never-been-so-easy-or-looked-so-good/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">entirely revamped consumer app</a>&#xA0;for iOS and Android devices. Available across the globe, the new app boasts a tab called &#x2018;Shop&#x2019;, which reimagines the in-store shopping experience for consumers by letting them pay, order ahead, or pay their check at the table at thousands of locations in the US, UK, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Canada.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Just four days later we unveiled&#xA0;<a title=\"PayPal Beacon\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paypal-beacon-finally-an-easier-way-to-pay-in-stores-than-swiping-a-credit-card/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal Beacon</a>, a new merchant add on that leverages the efficiency and flexibility of Bluetooth LE technology in many mobile phones to make it easy for customers to automatically check in and pay. This technology marks our most significant contribution to retail yet, by reinventing the in-store shopping experience. We challenged ourselves by asking, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s easier than swiping a credit card?&#x201D; and the answer simultaneously made us chuckle and gasp: doing nothing. PayPal Beacon makes it possible for there to be something easier and quicker than swiping a credit card to pay&#x2014;by letting the consumer do nothing to pay. It works with any PayPal compatible merchant POS system (there are dozens already &#x2013; in fact, Revel Systems announced compatibility&#xA0;<a title=\"this week\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/14/paypal-expands-real-world-presence-via-partnership-with-ipad-point-of-sale-maker-revel-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">this week</a>) and is&#xA0;<a title=\"a rich platform for developers too\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/beacon\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">a rich platform for developers too</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We completed our in-store trifecta at Money2020 with the announcement of Payment Code &#x2013; a simple and efficient way for merchants who still have old 2d barcode systems (or even just PIN Pads) at Point of Sale &#x2013; to join the digital payments revolution. Customers can pay by scanning a QR code or using a one-time generated PIN.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Online</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We announced two pilots &#x2013; one for consumers and another for merchants.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>1. In collaboration with eBay Enterprise, we&#x2019;ve crafted a limited time offer. Anyone who uses PayPal to make a purchase online at Levi&#x2019;s, Aeropostale, Sports Authority, Dockers, Dick&#x2019;s Sporting Goods, Kenneth Cole, iRobot, PBS and Maurices will receive&#xA0;<a title=\"free two day shipping in the US\" href=\"https://www.paypal-pages.com/2-day-shipping/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">free two day shipping in the US</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>2. For our online merchants, we announced PayPal Working Capital. Select PayPal small businesses have access to a business loan that allows them to get funding in minutes and repay with a share of their sales. There are no minimum payments. You make money, and we get paid back. It&#x2019;s that simple.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Demand Generation</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Consumers aren&#x2019;t looking for just a new way to pay, they want to save time and/or money. We believe that making it easier to claim and redeem offers is one benefit of the digital wallet that will drive more consumers to start using them. Offers right now are broken. Many consumers equate offers with spam&#x2014;they&#x2019;re not easy to redeem; people forget to bring them along when they&#x2019;re actually going to a store; or worse: they have an offer that&#x2019;s only redeemable online when they want to use it at the mall. PayPal&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a title=\"Closed Loop Offers\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/innovation/closed-loop-offers-save-money-for-consumers-and-drive-commerce-for-merchants/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Closed Loop Offers</a>&#xA0;changes the game. They enable merchants to put real money into a PayPal user&#x2019;s account to spend at their sites and stores. Redemption can be omnichannel (e.g. both in-store and online to provide flexibility and choice to the consumer) or designed to drive sales in one particular channel.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Wow, that&#x2019;s a lot. But there&#x2019;s more...</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We also launched&#xA0;<a title=\"PayPal in Russia\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-goes-live-with-13-merchants-in-russia/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal in Russia</a>, with 13 of the biggest names in Russian ecommerce.

Bangalore is known around the world as the center of tech innovation in India and will be the 17th eBay Inc. dev center around the world. We also held developer hackathons &#x2013;&#xA0;<a title=\"battlehacks\" href=\"http://battlehack.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">battlehacks</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; in London, Washington DC, Moscow and Austin TX &#x2013; with a chance to win a $100,000 prize at the world final next month in San Jose.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And in the midst of everything, we also announced our plans to buy Braintree for $800 million &#x2013; another company that&#x2019;s changing the world by innovating payments.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That was a crazy six weeks and even that is not everything.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Oct 16<br><strong style=\"\">David Marcus, President, PayPal</strong><br><br>I&#x2019;ve always believed in the power of numbers to tell a business story. As we&#x2019;ve been compiling our third quarter results, however, I&#x2019;ve been struck by how much of the story of what&#x2019;s going on at PayPal today goes beyond numbers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It&#x2019;s not that our financials are any less impressive than the results we&#x2019;ve shared in previous quarters. PayPal&#x2019;s results were strong in Q3. Active accounts increased by 5 million again, and now stand at 137 million. Revenue increased 20 percent* to $1.62 billion. Total payment volume reached $44 billion mark, a leap of 25 percent*. Off-eBay volume grew 30 percent, to $31 billion and PayPal penetration on eBay rose a full percentage point quarter over quarter to more than 78%, the highest ever. And we processed 729 million transactions in the quarter. To put that last number in context, it&#x2019;s equivalent to every person in the United States, South America and Australia making a transaction using PayPal during the past three months.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But to really understand what&#x2019;s happening, you have to look at the innovation coming from PayPal over the past three months. From this perspective, I think it&#x2019;s safe to say that we&#x2019;ve got our innovation mojo back.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For example, on September 5 we launched our brand new consumer mobile app with a wide range of new capabilities that make transactions simpler and a lot more fun, like the ability to skip the line if you&#x2019;re getting takeout by ordering ahead from the full menu. When you dine in, you can use the app to order more food or another drink, and then&#xA0;<a title=\"pay and leave a tip without waiting for a check from your server\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/innovation/check-please-tableside-payments-made-simple-with-paypal-and-viableware/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">pay and leave a tip without waiting for a check from your server</a>. If you use it to check-in at your favorite store, you can receive&#xA0;<a title=\"special offers\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/innovation/closed-loop-offers-save-money-for-consumers-and-drive-commerce-for-merchants/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">special offers</a>&#xA0;that are automatically redeemed at checkout.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In early September, we also unveiled&#xA0;<a title=\"PayPal Beacon\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/innovation/pay-pal-check-in-introducing-the-world-to-paypal-beacon/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal Beacon</a>, a new technology that reinvents in-store shopping in profound and important ways. With PayPal Beacon, paying is completely hands free: you don&#x2019;t need to pull out your wallet, swipe your card, or even open up an app on your phone. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (or BLE) technology to connect devices to each other seamlessly and at very low energy consumption levels. At stores where you choose to check in, your photo will appear on the point-of-sale system and all it takes for you to pay is a verbal confirmation.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal Beacon is also designed with your privacy and security in mind. It doesn&#x2019;t constantly track your location like other technologies, and if you enter a store and decline to check in, or just ignore the prompt entirely, no information is transmitted to PayPal or the merchant. When you do choose to check in with Beacon, all communications meet the high standards that you expect from PayPal for security and no financial or login data is exchanged.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the UK, we rolled out our&#xA0;<a title=\"PayPal Here Chip &amp;amp; PIN card reader\" href=\"https://www.paypal.co.uk/blog/paypal-here--paypal-s-new-chip-and-pin-solution-now-available/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal Here Chip &amp; PIN card reader</a>&#xA0;broadly after completing a successful exclusive launch in that market. This is an important product for markets where magnetic stripe cards aren&#x2019;t the standard. In mid-September, we expanded into Russia by offering people the ability to pay with PayPal in rubles. We also announced that&#xA0;<a title=\"more than a dozen of Russia&#x2019;s leading major retailers will accept payments using PayPal\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-goes-live-with-13-merchants-in-russia/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">more than a dozen of Russia&#x2019;s leading major retailers will accept payments using PayPal</a>, and we received applications for new merchant accounts from more than 2,000 local retailers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Each one of these announcements marks an important step forward in our continuous efforts to bring greater value and convenience to peoples&#x2019; lives by making paying and getting paid easier and safer. But the move that may have the greatest impact was&#xA0;<a title=\"our agreement to acquire Braintree\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/why-weve-agreed-to-acquire-braintree/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">our agreement to acquire Braintree</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Braintree is a phenomenal organization and a great fit for PayPal. They&#x2019;ve built a powerful mobile payments platform that is enabling some of the world&#x2019;s most exciting new businesses to offer game-changing experiences. Venmo, their consumer app, makes it easy and fun for people to send money to friends. I&#x2019;m thrilled to have both the Braintree and Venmo teams join the PayPal family.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Together, we look forward to further accelerating the pace of innovation here at PayPal as we build a new generation of delightful breakthrough experiences that solve everyday problems and enhance people&#x2019;s lives all around the world.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Oct 29<br><strong style=\"\">Brian Bieron, Executive Director, Global Public Policy, eBay Inc.</strong><br><br>PayPal is at the leading edge of the global, technology-enabled payments industry, serving 137 million consumers, entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes in 193 markets around the world. The industry has seen tremendous innovation and competition from players large and small, with rapidly evolving technologies driving change and progress towards a brighter future.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The payments industry is one that government policymakers and regulators around the world care deeply about. Yet, it&#x2019;s a common refrain among technology leaders that regulatory processes are far too slow to adapt. The general sense is that government cannot keep up with the rapid pace of innovation and creativity that is at the heart of today&#x2019;s successful business operations. PayPal believes that while specific regulatory processes or policies may seem frustratingly outmoded, it is critical to begin any meaningful discussion of payments regulation with a clear recognition that the core, real-world, societal goals underpinning payments industry regulation are timeless and valuable. Government goals of protecting consumers from fraud, fighting criminal abuse, protecting the stability of the financial system, and promoting commerce, economic empowerment and innovation are all important goals that PayPal supports and believes other industry leaders share.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The challenge is developing new regulatory models that better achieve societal goals and also support rapid innovation. PayPal is stepping forward to meet this challenge by beginning a collaborative discussion about how increasingly ubiquitous 21st Century technology and data-analytics techniques used by technology-enabled organizations can be used by government regulators to make better and faster decisions to help deliver better results.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This is a global challenge, and in response, PayPal is releasing reports and engaging in collaborative discussions this week in Singapore, Washington, DC and Trieste, Italy. The concept is not overly complicated. We recommend that regulators use the same data analytics techniques that have transformed the &#x201C;high tech&#x201D; payments sector in the same they have transformed the healthcare and getting-a-taxi industries. These techniques rely on collaboration and iteration; they use technology and data to measure performance and deliver results. We believe that implementing this new approach will enable regulators to better achieve their goals, benefit consumers, and allow for a faster pace of business innovation.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Rohan Mahadevan, VP, PayPal Asia Pacific releases&#xA0;</span><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ebaymainstreet.com/sites/default/files/PayPal-Payment-Regulations-Booklet-APAC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">&#x201C;Payments Regulation for Asia Pacific: A Model for Innovation and Growth&#x201D;</a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;at the American Chamber of commerce in Singapore.

In fact, our recent study&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://lanuevarutadelasespecias.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">&#x201C;La Nueva Ruta de las Especias&#x201D;</a>&#xA0;reveals that 40% of revenues from surveyed SMBs come from online sources. More and more, cross border commerce is leveling the playing field for Latin American merchants.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>One merchant that is benefiting from this trend is Caf&#xE9; Britt. Although Costa Rica is significantly smaller than other countries in the region, the Caf&#xE9; Britt team has been able to share the taste of &quot;tico&quot; gourmet coffee to people in Brazil, England, the United States and many more.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Caf&#xE9; Britt started with a small website in the early 90s and has since enhanced its business model with digital tools such as PayPal. Today, Caf&#xE9; Britt sells a variety of gourmet products, operating in approximately 100 gift shops in 10 countries. They are also launching Colombian Coffee this November.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with Adriana Echandi, Director of Retail for Caf&#xE9; Britt, who was happy to share their story on how they used e-commerce to better connect with their consumers.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What is Caf&#xE9; Britt&#x2019;s background story?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Caf&#xE9; Britt was the first roaster from a coffee-producing country to export gourmet coffee, not the raw material, to consumers around the world. We identified a niche market and positioned our coffee as the natural gift that tourists could bring home with them after their vacation. Our website allowed us to strengthen our presence among international buyers. Additionally, our business shows that in Latin America there is room for local innovative companies like ours to compete on the world stage and succeed.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What digital and mobile strategies is Caf&#xE9; Britt implementing to strengthen growth?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We want to reach customers wherever they are, and they&apos;re all spending more time online and on their phones. As a result we are always looking to improve how we use these channels to sell to and communicate with our audience. For example, along with our customer service number, we also offer live chat and e-mail assistance so users can place their orders or contact us at their convenience. And, we are working on offering location-based deals as well as providing discounted shipping rates based on user geo-location capabilities through mobile devices. We constantly look for ways to optimize cross-channel experiences for customers who switch between online and offline mediums. From a marketing perspective, we also focus on pushing consistent messaging out across channels, and we lean on content marketing and social marketing to enhance and maintain customer behavior online. Regardless of the channel, we strive to deliver targeted, relevant marketing messages to the right audience, and this is becoming easier and easier to do online. Additionally, a new Head of e-commerce has recently joined to take our vision forward.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What financial impact has cross border sales had on your company?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Cross border business is a core part of our business model, and as we&apos;ve begun to reach more and more customers all over the world, our business has grown in tandem. In the last 20 years, our total revenue grew from about $1 million to $115 million, from both local and international sources. Our e-commerce sales account for 5% of our total revenue.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">When and why did Caf&#xE9; Britt integrate PayPal as a payment solution?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We incorporated PayPal into our business in 2007, and our orders have only increased since that day. PayPal allows us to provide a safe payment option to our customers in almost any country in the world. Frankly, when selling online, safety is one of our biggest priorities, and that was a big driver behind why we chose PayPal. Likewise, we believe it is necessary to provide a trusted, international payment solution to ensure a good experience for our customers around the world. This in turn supports the bottom line of our business. Just last year, the increase in revenue from PayPal compared with 2008 was 54%, and we expect orders made with PayPal to keep on growing.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What are some successful digital strategies that you would recommend to an SMB who is trying to participate in cross border commerce?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We believe that the experience of the consumer is key to making business successful. Every part of the shopping process should be easy, safe and rewarding so customers continue to come back or refer the service to others. We would recommend that businesses evaluate their resources and implement an omni-channel approach so they can benefit from both online and offline selling efforts.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

We&#x2019;ve had a busy month innovating with new technologies including our new app and PayPal Beacon.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><a title=\"PayPal Beacon\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/innovation/pay-pal-check-in-introducing-the-world-to-paypal-beacon/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal Beacon</a>&#xA0;allows merchants to make check in seamless and automatic for consumers by letting them just pay with an image of their face that appears on a merchant&apos;s POS screen. But what if the merchant POS system doesn&#x2019;t have a screen that can display images? That&apos;s why today we&#x2019;re introducing Payment Code. No need to rip &amp; replace hardware at the point of sale to take advantage of leading edge technologies to make payments easy and drive consumer engagement.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This new technology lets consumers make purchases by scanning a QR code on their mobile phone, or receive a short four-digit code on their phone to complete a purchase. Payment code is an extension of our offerings for enhancing the payments experience in-store. Our approach isn&#x2019;t to push technology for technology&#x2019;s sake, but to truly make the paying experience better for consumers and to give merchants more opportunity to innovate without a costly investment. Payment code is easy to use and understand and utilizes a ubiquitous technology that merchants have and are familiar with.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">How does it work?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When you&#x2019;re ready to pay, simply open the PayPal app (or the specific merchant&#x2019;s app.) and check in. Once you&#x2019;re checked-in at that location, the app prompts you with a QR code, or a four-digit short code, to authenticate your purchase.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>If the merchant has a barcode or QR code scanner, the merchant scans and, just like that, you have paid. If the merchant doesn&#x2019;t then a four-digit code pops up on your phone, you (or the merchant) simply punch that code into the PIN pad at checkout. Boom, done!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What is the benefit to the consumer?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As we have said many times before, the problem that needs to be solved is not paying at a POS terminal. While payment code does make the checkout process smooth, with easy access to all funding sources in one simple place (your phone), the real benefit is that it will allow consumers to automatically redeem any special offers, gift cards, merchant rewards programs or other forms of payment that might be saved in their PayPal wallet in one quick transaction.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What is the merchant benefit?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our philosophy at PayPal is to make digital payments as easy as possible for both consumers and merchants. Many of the merchants we have talked to &#x2013; and trust us we have talked to a lot &#x2013; want to get the benefits of these new ways to pay but they don&#x2019;t want to rip out their existing technology to do it.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Payment code lets them take advantage of mobile payments using their old technology. Utilizing the millions of 2D barcode scanners already sitting on store counters and 40+ million payment terminals available around the world, this offers an easy way to give customers the benefits without investing in new technology.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">But what if the merchant already has a mobile app for their customers?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Those merchants with a mobile app and older systems can still use payment code by integrating it into their own mobile app. The PayPal QR code will then appear as within the merchant&#x2019;s own app.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We expect to roll out payment code globally in the first quarter of 2014, and look forward to sharing more at that time. This is just another way that we are driving new technologies and tools to help consumers and merchants of all sizes take advantage of the rising wave of digital payments.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

These programs include&#xA0;<a title=\"PinkPal&#xAE;\" href=\"http://www.brightpink.org/i-am-high-risk/what-is-a-pinkpal/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PinkPal&#xAE;</a>, a one-on-one peer support program, and<a title=\"Experiential Outreach Groups\" href=\"http://www.brightpink.org/i-am-high-risk/experiential-outreach-groups/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Experiential Outreach Groups</a>, Bright Pink&#x2019;s version of support group that pairs fun activities with facilitated discussions relevant to young high-risk women. These programs are designed to help high-risk women navigate the unique challenges associated with their risk status, as well as create a community of vibrant, confident and inspiring women.<br><br></li><li style=\"\">Bright Pink ensures medical professionals are armed with knowledge and resources to spark life-saving conversations with young women about their breast and ovarian cancer risk and early detection and risk reduction strategies.</li></ul><strong style=\"\">What are some of your biggest challenges in getting support?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>We are a relatively young organization with a small staff. When you start an organization from scratch, and you are trying to build an infrastructure, it can be exciting and challenging at times. We very much have a start-up organizational culture, and there are some milestones that we hit much earlier than expected, and others that take a bit longer to implement. For example, we just debuted our first annual report this year, and are now in development of our first women&#x2019;s philanthropy initiative and annual giving campaign.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Bright Pink&#x2019;s programs and resources are geared towards young women, who sometimes do not have the financial assets to fuel our programs. So it&#x2019;s important for us continue to serve these women and simultaneously grow our relationships with major donors, family foundations, and corporate partners who have the power to support us in that capacity. We rely on a 360 degree approach, using multiple channels to maintain constant, supportive conversations will all of these various stakeholders.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">How does Bright Pink currently use PayPal?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Bright Pink depends on PayPal to process our online donations made through BrightPink.org.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Why do you like using PayPal to collect donations?&#xA0;</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is easy, save, secure, and familiar to our online visitors.

Week two focuses on mobile security. As a leader in mobile payments, PayPal is excited to play a role in NCSA&#x2019;s efforts to help people understand what they can do to stay secure when they are connected to the Internet on a mobile device. After all, mobile commerce is a vital&#x2014;and fast growing&#x2014;part of our business. We know that to achieve our vision of fast, friction free payments, it&#x2019;s essential that consumers feel safe and secure when they use their mobile devices to shop.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As part of our support for Cyber Security Awareness Month, we have been working with NCSA to get a clearer picture of how people use are really using their mobile devices today, and to find out what they do&#x2014;and don&#x2019;t&#x2014;know about the safety issues they might face. So, in partnership with NCSA, we commissioned a survey of 1,000 adults in the United States.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The results of that study underscore just how deeply entrenched in our daily lives mobile devices have become. For example, two-thirds of the people we contacted told us that their smartphone is never further than one room away, and one in ten said they keep their phone handy everywhere they go, with the possible exception of the bathroom. In addition, the survey highlighted the growing importance of mobile devices as a tool for shopping, with one in four respondents reporting that they complete at least one transaction per day on their smartphone, while one in six say they make at least 25 percent of all their purchases on their smartphone.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But the survey also uncovered a general sense of unease about the security of financial information on mobile devices if lost or stolen, and it made clear that many people aren&#x2019;t taking the steps they need to take to use their mobile devices safely.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We discovered, for example, that nearly 70 percent of Americans believe that storing payment information on their smartphone is unsafe. At PayPal, customer&#x2019;s information is securely stored in the cloud. We also found that 63 percent of the people we surveyed don&#x2019;t have a clear idea about what financial information is stored on their smartphones and more than half don&#x2019;t lock their mobile device with a PIN.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>What this means is that people aren&#x2019;t as safe as they should be, and that by following a few simple tips from PayPal and NCSA, they can achieve greater security and better peace of mind:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Always activate a PIN or lock function for your mobile device</span>: A PIN is the simplest and most important thing you can do to ensure security on your mobile device especially if it is lost or stolen.</li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Automate software updates</span>: Many software programs automatically connect and update to defend against known risks. Turn on automatic updates on your mobile device if that&#x2019;s an available option.</li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Use common sense when downloading apps</span>: Unknown or repackaged apps can contain malware designed to steal financial information from a mobile device, so always purchase or download apps from companies that you trust and check reviews. When installing new applications, review permissions and decide whether you&#x2019;re comfortable granting the access that an application asks for.</li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Enable &#x201C;Find My Device&#x201D;</span>: If your phone, carrier, or antivirus software supports the &#x201C;find my device&#x201D; feature, it&#x2019;s a good idea to activate it. This functionality will help you find your device if it&#x2019;s lost or stolen, and lock it or wipe it clean remotely if you need to.</li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Backup your device</span>: It is critical to backup your device on a regular basis. Some operating systems offer this option as an automated service. If you ever need to exercise the remote wipe feature mentioned above, you will be glad you have a current backup that you can recover to a new device.</li></ul>In the survey, we found that many people are open to new approaches to mobile security that would increase their safety. In particular, there are strong indications that many people are willing to take advantage of biometric technology to protect themselves against mobile security threats. Our survey found that Americans are overwhelmingly comfortable replacing passwords with newer security technologies such as fingerprint identification (53 percent) and retinal scans (45 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal has always been passionate about protecting customers, and we go to great lengths to do so with purchase protection, storing information securely in the cloud, and utilizing advanced technologies for fraud detection. We are also at the forefront of industry-wide efforts such as the&#xA0;<a title=\"FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-leads-industry-effort-to-move-beyond-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance</a>&#xA0;to develop new and better ways to make online authentication faster, easier, and more secure.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At the same time, we know that individuals have a vital role to play in making sure their personal and payment information is safe. Our hope is that continued innovation and education from great organizations like NCSA will help consumers understand what they can do to take advantage of a new generation of amazing mobile commerce experiences with greater confidence that their information is well-protected.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>If you&#x2019;re interested in learning more, please join us for a Mobile &amp; On the Go Twitter Chat on Thursday, October 10 at 3 p.m. ET.

Today there are those of us who can grocery shop from the comfort of our own living rooms, share face time with friends and family from the road, and keep tabs on virtually every aspect of both our personal and professional lives using a device small enough to fit in our pockets.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Sometimes, however, this new space and can be as overwhelming as it is awesome, and being more connected often just ends up feeling like MORE.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And so the great challenge of our time has become developing solutions with a less-is-more approach, in hopes that by raising the bar of digital intuition, the tools we create will simplify rather than over complicate.

I was on the road and couldn&#x2019;t write him a check, but wanted him to get the money right away. I took out my phone and sent him the money through the PayPal app and he received it immediately. This is one of the ways that PayPal is making MY life easier.

Here&#x2019;s the scenario: your car breaks down and you know why, but you don&#x2019;t know how &#x2013; or perhaps don&#x2019;t have the time &#x2013; to fix it. Is it ok to source the parts online and ask the workshop if they are ok to just charge labour for the install?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What Should we Pay for?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As a PayPal employee in the little old island of Australia driving a European 4WD, I know that I am better off buying parts online than via my mechanic. I will trust the smallest of online retailers as long as they provide PayPal as an option. This way I know that my coils, drive shaft, or braided brake lines will be covered in the event that they don&#x2019;t arrive.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Online I can do more research; I scan forums, I scour reviews, and I consider price. In the end this means I am able to get exactly what I want for a price that suits my need (shipping is cheaper than air freight and often I am happy to wait).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So, again, is it ok for me to take the parts I have purchased independently to the mechanic and ask them to fit them? I think it is. As this isn&#x2019;t where the mechanic adds value &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the skills of the trade. The mechanic didn&#x2019;t spend years studying and enduring an apprenticeship to learn how to order spare parts.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>An argument I raised to my unconvinced friend is that some restaurants are BYO (Bring Your Own) and this allows you to bring a nice bottle of wine without paying through the nose. If the restaurant is truly focused on their food, the money shouldn&#x2019;t get in the way of a good consumer experience, right?!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The Technology and Consumer Convenience Shift</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I guess my point is that technology and consumer convenience are shifting the way we do business in many ways and its effects are felt more broadly than we often think.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While the mobile phone is disrupting traditional retail and empowering the customer in ways never previously imagined, so too is traditional online commerce as consumers, just like me, use the reach of services like PayPal to buy products from around the world. So even though I work for the company, my Land Rover Defender and I would like to say a big thanks to PayPal for connecting us with great merchants around the world who are keeping us on the road.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And to close &#x2013; props to my mechanic who is very supportive of my approach. He actually appreciates not having as many cars in his shop sitting around taking up space as the parts sit on order.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

As North America&#x2019;s oldest retailer and Canada&#x2019;s first company, Hudson&#x2019;s Bay, the department store, has come a long way. It&#x2019;s incredible to consider their journey from a simple fur trading post to a sought-after fashion and lifestyle destination selling luxury brands.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Just this week, HBC completed the acquisition of the equally loved American retailer, Saks Fifth Avenue. In the U.S., Hudson&apos;s Bay Company now operates Saks Fifth Avenue stores,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/Entry.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">saks.com</a>, 69 Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH stores and&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.saksoff5th.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">saksoff5th.com</a>. The company also operates&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.lordandtaylor.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lord-and-taylor\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Lord &amp; Taylor</a>, the oldest specialty retail department store chain in the United States. Both brands offer PayPal at check out for our U.S. consumers. In Canada, we&#x2019;d call that a hat-trick (three successes in a row).<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Fashion Forward</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our collaboration with Hudson&apos;s Bay Company is all about bringing fashion and fantastic brands to people who love shopping with PayPal. Whether you&apos;re in Toronto shopping on thebay.com or in&#xA0;New York City shopping on saksfifthavenue.com or lordandtaylor.com, we&apos;re committed to making the experience fun and easy.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Luxury retailers in Canada have been slower to embrace omnichannel. As Hudson&apos;s Bay Company is the first Canadian luxury department store to have added online to their brick-and-mortar presence, we&#x2019;re delighted that they accept PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Of course, I shopped the minute PayPal was accepted. My first purchase was a pair of&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.thebay.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/thebay/birch-high\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Santana Birch High boots</a>&#xA0;and a&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.thebay.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/thebay/reversible-quilted-jacket-0079-rswjf14-04--24\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Sochi jacket</a>&#xA0;from HBC&#x2019;s 2014 Canadian Olympic team collection. I have to say, I was incredibly impressed with HBC&#x2019;s service and fast delivery time. I shopped online at 2:00PM in two clicks with PayPal and my order arrived at the same time the next day. Now that&#x2019;s record shipping time for Canada. I was so impressed that I placed another order for cosmetics, some great earrings and their ever-popular&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.thebay.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/thebay/snow-top-red-mittens\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Olympic mittens</a>. I had the same fantastic experience on my second order, so it certainly won&#x2019;t be my last.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Trusted brands, cross-border collaboration, plus PayPal! For me, this week could not get more exciting. I must get back to shopping...I mean working!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

I&#x2019;ve been particularly fascinated to see how aware my 12-year-old daughter, Sadie, has become of POS systems and PayPal Here competitors, just from her exposure to my work.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The Carolina Blue Dogs</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Sadie was recently assigned a school project to create and market a Major League Baseball team for the Charlotte region (we currently only have minor league). Part of the exercise was to come up with a logo and promotional items to eventually sell. After a bit of brainstorming, the Carolina Blue Dogs were born and the logo was put onto hats and cups. But Sadie took it a step further when she decided to actually make these items sellable, and asked for a PayPal reader to use with her phone. As you can see in the photo below, she even promoted &#x201C;being blue&#x201D; to sell the Carolina Blue Dogs gear.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This project was presented right before I attended eBay Inc&#x2019;s Women&#x2019;s Initiative Network (WIN) conference &#x2013; an internal program sponsored by PayPal&#x2019;s CEO, John Donahoe &#x2013; and one of the messages that really hit home was around the lack of women in technology. I thought of Sadie and couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder,&#xA0;<span style=\"\">How can I take my daughter&#x2019;s fascination with the PayPal Here product, her love of math, and help her become part of the conversation?</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Spreading Awareness for the Greater Good</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I think as leaders within the disruptive community we have an obligation to ask ourselves big questions like these, and as technology continues to influence lifestyle, an even bigger obligation to answer them.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For me, that answer currently resides in awareness. WIN has exposed me to so many helpful programs for the upcoming generation, such as&#xA0;<a title=\"Girls Who Code\" href=\"http://www.girlswhocode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Girls Who Code</a>. The more I learn, the more I can teach and encourage my daughter, and right now the focus on the importance of diversity and inclusion, buttressed by the ongoing efforts of WIN, taps right into that channel.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ll need to keep the momentum going in other ways as well, but by allowing employees the opportunity to regularly be a part of such a transformative discussion, I think PayPal is moving in the right direction. When we have the means to learn, and, in effect, expose our children to the ways of technology, we encourage them to create even better ideas to connect commerce, and we effectively springboard ourselves into an even more successful future.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

As PayPal&#x2019;s Head of Social Media, I&#x2019;ve had the privilege of seeing some wonderful and successful projects executed, including our&#xA0;<a title=\"guest Instagram initiatives\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/innovation/paypal-highlighted-on-instagram-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">guest Instagram initiatives</a>, one of the first-ever<a title=\"Instagram photo booths\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/paypal/outside-lands/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Instagram photo booths</a>&#xA0;at Outside Lands, and most recently, the platform&#x2019;s choice to&#xA0;<a title=\"include PayPal in their ads launch\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paypal-is-bringing-ads-to-instagram/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">include PayPal in their ads launch</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Once a sanctuary for the younger crowd, Instagram is now a popular storytelling platform for a range of age groups and demographics. Beyond that, the platform has evolved into a powerful marketing tool for business. Through Instagram, PayPal has had the opportunity to not only engage with our existing customers, but expand our social audience.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For my team and I, the golden ticket lies in Instagram&#x2019;s authenticity. People love to get an inside look and feel, whether it&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes at Outside Lands or a press conference we&#x2019;re hosting. People like to feel like they&#x2019;re a part of the action, so the more brands allow their audience members to join these experiences, the more success they will find.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That being said, I&#x2019;m not recommending you should sign up for an account and start posting haphazardly. Building a brand story on any social platform takes time and thought. Whether you&#x2019;re a seasoned social media professional or just starting out on Instagram, there are a few practices I&#x2019;ve helped set in motion here at PayPal that every business should consider.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1. Don&#x2019;t just talk about yourself.</strong>&#xA0;Nobody likes it when you&#x2019;re too self-serving, so it&#x2019;s good to mix up your content a bit. In addition to the products and services you can purchase through PayPal, we like to share photos of the various&#xA0;<a title=\"sights\" href=\"http://instagram.com/p/bH0RtZqzoB/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">sights</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a title=\"treats\" href=\"http://instagram.com/p/br4eH_Kzu7/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">treats</a>&#xA0;we come across, just so people know that we too like to take breaks now and then to enjoy our surroundings. When we are sharing about products and services you can purchase via PayPal, we want our followers to feel like they are right there with us, whether it&#x2019;s enjoying a cup of coffee or buying a gift for a friend.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Hand over your credentials.</strong>&#xA0;In addition to sharing content from the PayPal perspective, we often partner with Instagram photographers to document their own PayPal experience on our account. At Outside Lands, for example, British singer-songwriter Jessie Ware gave our followers a peek at her backstage life. While these photos didn&#x2019;t directly exhibit the PayPal brand at an initial glance, they did show our followers our event partnership and relationships.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. Encourage larger conversations.</strong>&#xA0;A conversation should be just that--a conversation. In addition to showing our followers what we&#x2019;re all about, we use our Instagram account to ask them about their lives. Asking questions invites comments, which can enable you to get to know your community members as well as provide them an opportunity to get to know each other. We want to be sharing content that our community is genuinely interested in and it all starts with asking them what exactly that is.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While these specific PayPal examples may not directly apply to your business, it&#x2019;s wise to start thinking of the content you share on social platforms as a way to exhibit a lifestyle rather than solely push products and brand messaging. Lending personal flair to the photo stream connects you to your community on a more personal level and lets followers get a sense of the personalities behind your brand. All in all, it&#x2019;s more fun to be creative and strategic with your content rather than just posting and calling it a day.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>What brands do you think are &#x201C;doing it right&#x201D; on Instagram? Share with me on Twitter&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3357\" style=\"\">@PAYPAL</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4812258\" style=\"\">@davepeck</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Even more telling is that many shoppers avoided physical stores altogether, left empty handed after spotting a nasty line, or ran straight to their couch to shop online.

We pull dogs of all kinds and ages, including newborns and those with permanent disabilities, from facilities around the state so that they can be placed safely and comfortably in caring homes. In addition to providing health care (spay and neuter, vaccines, and medical attention), training, socialization, and rehabilitation services for the dogs we take in, we also advocate for greater public awareness concerning the importance of spay/neuter operations and responsible animal care. We believe that a dog is a member of the family and should be treated as such, and that means having regular access to the home (not just left in the backyard) and receiving all the love and affection that a human family member gets! Family Dog Rescue runs almost entirely by local volunteers, alums, and our communities&apos; continued generosity.

Due to this we don&#x2019;t have to rely solely on foster homes (although we still need those too) and thus can save even more dogs. Family Dog Rescue is also passionate about helping dogs with disabilities and educating people about the fact that disabled dogs are just as trainable and loving as &quot;regular&quot; dogs. We also strive to find dogs that are good with kids, because we feel it&apos;s important for children to grow up with animals.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What are some of your biggest challenges in getting support?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Muttville</strong>: In the beginning, the challenge really was about getting people to want to adopt a demographic of dogs once considered &quot;<a title=\"unadoptable\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HXfUuNbpo4\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">unadoptable</a>&quot;. I think we have overcome that stigma, and we hear people proudly say, &quot;I&apos;ve got a Muttville dog!&quot; Now it&#x2019;s about increasing the numbers. Even though we&#x2019;re one of the only rescues who save senior dogs, for every dog we save, there are still at least 20 we must turn away. We need more money and more space so that we can save MORE senior dogs.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Family Dog Rescue</strong>: One of the biggest challenges in getting support is awareness. Many people, even within San Francisco, don&apos;t know about smaller independent rescues and how much we need support! We want people to know who we are and how important it is to adopt, and we want to continue to grow and save more and more dogs. We can&apos;t do that without the help and support of our community.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">How does the organization currently use PayPal?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Muttville</strong>: We&apos;ve been using PayPal since day one. It is our main method of direct donations, and the most reliable. PayPal is on our Give page AND how people buy tickets for our big annual fundraiser,&#xA0;<a title=\"Moolah For Mutts\" href=\"http://events.muttville.org/moolah-for-mutts/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Moolah For Mutts</a>. We haven&apos;t changed the PayPal method since Muttville&apos;s website launched in 2007! But we want to utilize all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; so we have a plan to incorporate more features in 2014.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Family Dog Rescue</strong>: Family Dog Rescue has been using PayPal since we began in order to collect donations. We have a badge on our website, and we are able to link it to specific fundraisers that we run. Verifying our PayPal account on third party sites is always quick and easy. Also it&apos;s really helpful that almost everyone has a PayPal account! We can easily collect our adoption donations online, which is great because we no longer accept checks.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Why do you like using PayPal to collect donations? Do you use it for anything else? Do your customers like using PayPal?</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Muttville</strong>: We know that everyone feels comfortable with PayPal and it is reliable. Everyone trusts PayPal. Many offers come our way, and they also come and go. We know that PayPal is here to stay.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Family Dog Rescue</strong>: As I mentioned, it&apos;s fantastic! I think adopters/donors like using PayPal because they are familiar with the site, know how to use it, and can trust that their money is going to get to where it&apos;s supposed to. All we have to do is tell them &quot;You can donate on PayPal&quot; and that&apos;s it - its simplicity really makes our lives easier. If it was a more complicated or longer process I think it&apos;d make getting donations harder - they may not remember the site name, etc. Also these days people rarely have cash and checks, but have smart phones and can make the donation right then and there.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">How can others get involved in your organization&#x2019;s cause?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Muttville</strong>: Adopt! Donate! Volunteer! Foster! Choose what is best for you. Any amount of support is appreciated. 3 hours a week sitting in the doggy loft and giving belly rubs and TLC means the world to these dogs.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Family Dog Rescue</strong>: People can get involved in many ways! We always need shelter volunteers to walk dogs and enrich their lives - applications can be found on our website. We also encourage people to help out at weekend adoption events - the more people we have, the more dogs we can bring out to meet the public! And of course donations of any kind - leashes, towels, bedding, and monetary donations - are incredibly helpful. And of course, by adopting!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Would you recommend PayPal to another nonprofit</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Muttville</strong>: We have proven success and reliability working with PayPal. PayPal is the payment method we could stand by without a doubt. Plus the support and relationship PayPal has built with us is amazing. We are always getting calls checking in and offering to help us grow or help promote our cause.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Family Dog Rescue</strong>: Definitely. It is a reputable, well-known site and its simplicity is key. Nonprofits rely on donations, so of course we want to make it as easy for our donors as possible. I really have no idea what we&apos;d do if we couldn&apos;t utilize PayPal! In addition we can always confirm what payments have come in from what adopters, and they money is quickly deposited into our bank account.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What are your organization&#x2019;s social media channels?</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Muttville</strong>: We heavily use&#xA0;<a title=\"Facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Muttville.Senior.Dog.Rescue\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Facebook</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/muttville\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Twitter</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"Pinterest\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/muttville/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Pinterest</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a title=\"Instagram\" href=\"http://instagram.com/muttville\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Instagram</a>.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Oct 22<br><strong style=\"\">Lee Brooke, Senior Director, Communications, PayPal EMEA</strong><br><br><br>When I joined PayPal nearly five months ago, it represented a significant personal change for me: I was leaving Nokia where I&#x2019;d been leading communications around the company&#x2019;s reinvention of its smartphone strategy to lead all communications across Europe, Middle East and Africa for PayPal, which is busily reinventing itself around mobile. I also moved countries&#x2014;from Helsinki where Nokia is based, to Luxembourg, where PayPal has its European headquarters. Along with this shift were subtle differences that only became apparent later: moving from a corporate headquarters to a regional headquarters requires a change in mindset; moving from a European company to a North American company brings some interesting differences in corporate personality.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>One thing I&#x2019;ve been adapting to since I joined PayPal is the differences in our business across the globe. While Nokia pretty much made one version of a phone (barring a few network technology variances), paying with PayPal can mean many different things in different places: authorizing in-store payments by giving the cashier a friendly smile in the UK, or scanning a QR code in a shop window in Germany to have a pair of shoes sent to your home are just a couple of examples.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Finding Constants</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Communications people are generally comfortable with change - very little is predictable about our daily work schedule &#x2013; and we know the easiest way to make sense of change is to find constants.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Then, last month, I found one. I was in Moscow for the launch of PayPal locally. We were standing around after the press conference when a journalist came over to chat. He&#x2019;d arrived late and wanted to be briefed on what we&#x2019;d announced. I began running through the 13 merchants who would start accepting PayPal payments in Russian rubles and halfway through he stopped me: &#x2018;wait. Are you telling me I can pay for my groceries online using PayPal and I don&#x2019;t have to hope that when they turn up at my house, I have the cash lying around?&#x2019; (With unreliable delivery infrastructure and a cash-on-delivery culture in Russia, you usually need to have cash to give the delivery driver, whenever he might turn up.)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s great news! I&#x2019;ll be using PayPal for all my groceries from now on.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It was that simple. Whatever the challenge locally, whether it&#x2019;s distrust of banks in Italy or Spain, unreliable logistics in Russia or cumbersome bank transfers in Germany, PayPal&#x2019;s goal is to make paying easier. That&#x2019;s the constant.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The Method Behind the Madness</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Change unsettles people, plain and simple. Even if people accept change as necessary, they search for reassurance in constants. It&#x2019;s a pattern we see repeated all around us, like TV sitcom plotlines or the predictability of the changing seasons (unless you live in Helsinki in which case there&#x2019;s only two seasons &#x2013; a really long winter and a really short, but gloriously sunny summer).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Communications people help engage, explain and debate. If we do it well, we succeed in helping people find what is constant and feel comfortable with what is changing. It&#x2019;s a role that offers immediate feedback: you see or hear straight away if people don&#x2019;t understand or don&#x2019;t feel comfortable and you try again. That&#x2019;s one of the things I love about what I do &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a journey that never really ends.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

In most cases, we are informed if a transaction needs further verification within 48 hours of the payment being made, and as they are reviewing the transaction. As a result we are able to hold what we are doing for that particular customer and wait for the verification from PayPal.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As for shopping carts, Camera Paradise was pleasantly surprised when conversions starting going up after implementing PayPal. &#x201C;We started using PayPal&#x2019;s express checkout in mid-2012, and immediately we saw a 20-23% increase in orders,&#x201D; added Bally. &#x201C;I believe this is simply because it&#x2019;s faster, easier and much more convenient for customers to complete their transaction.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Oct 23<br><strong style=\"\">Marc Jaugey, Director of Communications + Social Media, PayPal EMEA</strong><br><br><br>I&apos;m half German and half French, I lived in Africa and the Middle East for the first 12 years of my life, and today I&#x2019;m the director of Communications and Social Media at PayPal EMEA, a region that covers 100+ markets from France to Israel and from Spain to Russia. I&#x2019;ve spent both my personal and professional life interacting with lots of different nationalities every single day.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today, being a Spaniard at 10 AM, a German at 11, and then switching my mind to Swedish and Russian in the afternoon is an exercise I love. (Although it often takes time to revert back to a French father and husband again every evening.) But working with different cultures can be fairly challenging for most.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Over the years I&#x2019;ve learned&#x2014;sometimes the hard way&#x2014;how to manage international situations in a business context, and while I&apos;m sure I&#x2019;ve made some mistakes and exhibited some tactlessness along the way, there are a few major tips I would give to anyone in a similar role. They&#x2019;re not rocket science; just basic practices that I feel make my interactions at PayPal more efficient.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1. Always put yourself in others&#x2019; shoes</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Misinterpretation is one of the most profound causes of friction in Communications, and obvious things are sometimes the most difficult to agree on as a group. This is a natural tendency for all of us. Anthropologists call it ethnocentrism, which is defined as the way we scale and rate others with reference to our own person or group, often leading us to consider ourselves as superior.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Example: Patriotism is a very important cultural element in Japan. You owe something to your birthplace as an individual. I can also see it as a strong element in the US, where the strength of the nation is part of everyone&#x2019;s sensitivity.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>On the opposite end, individuals in other countries are often less incline to analyze things through this lens, but more steered by a sense of history. (like the &#x201C;ancient&#x201D; Europe vs. the rest of the world.)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Because of this, I never try to give my specific sense to something, but always try to put myself in others&#x2019; shoes.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I always ask my audience, &quot;Does this make sense for you?&quot; Or, &quot;Are you comfortable with this idea?&quot; Checking step by step if we are all on the same page is crucial. And if I&#x2019;m not sure, I just ask! I prefer to be seen as someone who has not understood than as someone who does not care.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Remember: Not everyone wakes up every day with the same goals</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>While I myself and most of my French or German colleagues are known for taking time to analyze the present before considering the future, many of my US and Indian peers approach the future with incredible ease.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Example: After seven years at PayPal, I&apos;m still amazed how people&#x2014;especially those in Silicon Valley&#x2014;wake up daily with strong desire to &quot;CHANGE THE WORLD.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Understanding this passion was key to understanding many of my colleagues, and I have to admit that it took me 6 to 8 months to integrate this into my thinking. For me, this daily &quot;risk factor&quot; is tied to the &quot;resistance to change&#x201D; but guess what: this is an amazingly important component in an industry like payments, which is changing so fast, and in a company like PayPal that is constantly innovating and developing.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At the end of the day it&#x2019;s important to recognize that we don&#x2019;t all have the same goals nor the same way of getting things done. Some individuals need a long and detailed report to learn all lessons from an initiative before they can jump to the next one, while others are already working on their next event before the former one has ended!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So when it comes to business collaboration, I always make sure to align vision before moving to execution.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. Avoid politics, be cautious with humor and always be on time</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In my experience I&#x2019;ve found that humor and politics hold the biggest evidence of cultural differences, making them the most difficult to communicate or understand.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Example: After many years of friendship, I&apos;m still trying to explain to my US friends what &quot;liberal&quot; means in France. And I&apos;m still trying to understand a joke that made all my Dutch colleagues burst out laughing.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In business relationships, I find it best to avoid these fields&#x2014;particularly in e-mail where not only can meaning be lost, but tone as well&#x2014;until I know my counterpart and feel comfortable with his or her knowledge of me as well. Communications don&#x2019;t have to be stiff to be effective, but when speaking across geographies it&#x2019;s smart to keep them gentle.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Another thing that I&#x2019;m forcing myself to do is to be always on time. Whatever the cultural background might be, believe me, nobody will ever reproach you for being on time.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">In Conclusion&#x2026;</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>Boundaries are blurring and this is not a new circumstance. Marshall McLuhan famously described the &quot;global village&quot; in&#xA0;<a title=\"The Medium is the Message\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Medium-Massage-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/1584230703\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">The Medium is the Message</a>. This is true for businesses (size has become a crucial success factor) and this is true for people (we&#x2019;re often asked to work with other countries, or even report to someone from another culture.)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In this context, success depends on how companies and individuals are able to take advantage of this.

While aware of Brazil&apos;s tech-forward mindset, I have been enlivened by the startup spirit that is driving business in technology here. That&apos;s why I&#x2019;m really excited to share some great news with you all today: Brazilians can now check in with their PayPal consumer app to pay, marking the first time we&#x2019;ve offered an in-store payment option in this region.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>More specifically, we&#x2019;ve partnered with Suplicy Caf&#xE9; in Sao Paulo to help coffee lovers get their fix without having to worry about cash or cards. And while caffeine during rush hour is certainly always a plus, the aim in launching this pilot is to learn more about our customers &#x2013; both merchants and consumers &#x2013; and help provide an easier way to pay that is right for the local market.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Since we opened our Brazilian offices in April 2011, our services in this area have been widely received by nearly 2 million active users. This country has an extremely tech-savvy community that&#x2019;s always looking for opportunities to boost security and save time. For example, last year we announced a one-of-a-kind partnership with Vivo that allowed consumers to top up their minutes straight from their mobile device without a smartphone or an Internet connection.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Moreover, the potential in the Brazilian market for shaping the future of commerce continues to grow at a rapid rate. Numerically speaking, the number of individual mobile Internet users is expected to nearly triple over the next four years (reaching approximately 96.4 million in 2016), and we&#x2019;re both excited and deeply honored to be able to help lead the way along with our partners.

The leaves haven&#x2019;t even started to change color and yet the retail industry has already moved on to October 31st.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Then I remembered&#xA0;<a title=\"an amazing statistic\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/commerce/paypal-data-shows-that-holiday-2012-started-september-30th/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">an amazing statistic</a>&#xA0;that came out last year. Because PayPal processes nearly one-fifth of global e-commerce, we can see trends as they appear. Traditionally, we see a rise in PayPal transaction volume for holiday shopping that kicks off before Thanksgiving and continues until the end of December. However, when we looked at the data for 2012, we saw that the US holiday shopping season started on September 30th!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the words of Jon Stewart of&#xA0;<span style=\"\">The Daily Show,</span>&#xA0;&quot;<a title=\"&#x201C;Christmas is so big now, it&#x2019;s eating other holidays&#x201D;\" href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-december-3-2012/the-war-on-christmas--friendly-fire-edition\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Christmas is so big now, it&#x2019;s eating other holidays</a>.&quot;&#xA0;It&#x2019;s more than just the length of the season. Consumers remain hungry to snap up the best offers available, but today they are shopping from a global marketplace&#x2014;not just the stores down the street. This is part of a much bigger trend: technology is fundamentally changing the retail calendar. Holiday shopping not only starts earlier and ends later, but new services such as&#xA0;<a title=\"eBay Now\" href=\"http://www.ebay.com/now/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">eBay Now</a>&#xA0;allow for the online shopping season to extend to Christmas Eve and more and more of us are shopping from our mobile devices at all times of day and night.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This is an incredible opportunity for both domestic and international merchants to tap into this phenomenon early. We recently released a report on what we called the&#xA0;<a title=\"modern day spice routes\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-unveils-modern-spice-routes-cross-border-shopping-creates-economic-opportunity-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">modern day spice routes</a>, which found the global cross border shopping opportunity to be worth more than $100 billion in the top 6 markets alone. Almost 100 million consumers around the world are shopping cross border and that number is expected to explode in the next few years.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So what are you waiting for? Despite the fact that the weather report says it&#x2019;s hot and sunny in San Francisco and I&#x2019;m wearing shorts today, the holiday shopping season is about to start. For merchants, this is a chance to take advantage of the extended season. For consumers, if you get in early, you can get the best deals from retailers selling from around the world.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Sept 30<br><strong style=\"\">Kristen Gohr, Head of Global Employee Communications, PayPal</strong><br><br>Over the years, the shelves in my home office have filled themselves with books on leadership &#x2013; 87 to be exact. Topics range from execution and decision making to why nice girls don&#x2019;t get the corner office, and I&#x2019;ve read (or at least started to read) each and every single one.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&#x2019;ve spent the past twenty years reading about leadership and the last 15 practicing it, and yet the biggest a-ha moment -- the moment I genuinely believed I found my true leadership swagger -- came sometime in the past three years working at PayPal.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Making a Change for Authenticity</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Anyone who has ever worked at a large corporation knows employee communications are typically dry, boring, and peppered with words that are long on syllables and short on meaning. Pop culture frequently speaks to this reality&#x2013;Dilbert, The Office, Office Space, etc.&#x2014;because so many of us would rather count the number of dust specks on our desk than read another &#x201C;Letter from the CEO.&#x201D; For years I too fell in line with these industry norms and admittedly wrote hundreds, if not thousands of &#x201C;circular file&#x201D; worthy communications.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But that changed when I came to PayPal. Over time the company&#x2019;s culture, people, and the purpose of the work I do here served as a forcing function, propelling me towards becoming a more authentic leader. Ultimately, I had to dig deep and be more transparent and human than I&#x2019;d ever been in my life.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I knew that if I was going to authentically lead and accurately represent the brand and our culture, I couldn&#x2019;t accept the same old &#x201C;buzz-word of the month&#x201D; type of communication I&#x2019;d produced for so long. So I didn&#x2019;t. Instead, I started working towards a 180-degree transformation - embracing and demanding authenticity from not just myself, but also everyone on my team. Now we use communications guidelines like, &#x201C;Keep it human &#x2013; if you wouldn&#x2019;t say it like this to your friends, don&#x2019;t write or say it.&#x201D; I spend less time worrying about proper punctuation, and more time trying to show our employees what we&#x2019;re all about: Putting our customers first. Craftsmanship. Passion. Being a disruptive force for good.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We do this through straightforward, honest and genuine words that are sometimes funny, sometimes abrupt and a bit startling, but (hopefully) never fake. We might not always get it right &#x2013; we still have moments where we overuse crunchy corporate words like &#x201C;strategy&#x201D; and &#x201C;leverage&#x201D; &#x2013; but we&#x2019;re heading in the right direction.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3 Tips for Finding Your Leadership Swagger</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The point is that being authentic leader - whether you&#x2019;re a person or a company - means facing your reality head on: the good and the bad. So here are my top three tips on how I face reality every day and am using this to become a more authentic leader:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1.&#xA0;Stop reading leadership books.&#xA0;</strong>Ok, you don&#x2019;t have to stop completely, but at least stop trying to emulate every new hot leadership approach that&#x2019;s out there &#x2013; including the ones about authentic leadership. I try to give myself the freedom to do what I think is right for me. I learned a long time ago that if doesn&#x2019;t feel natural, it probably looks even less natural to those on the receiving end. Leadership at its core is about being real and genuine, not about becoming a mold of others. Your true self can and will inspire others around you to be their best.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Learn about yourself.&#xA0;</strong>This seems obvious, but seriously, get clear on what you&#x2019;re good at and make it your job (I like to use Gallup&#x2019;s Strengthfinders and other tests like MBTI). I&#x2019;m passionate about the work I do partially because I can be successful at doing it. It taps into the core of who I am. Knowing what you&#x2019;re not so good at is equally important. I&#x2019;ve had an unofficial &#x201C;personal board of directors&#x201D; for years. They&#x2019;re people that I trust, and I seek their feedback on a regular basis. Often times they see my strengths and weaknesses more clearly than I can. I never mask my shortcoming, I embrace them and I don&#x2019;t let them hold me back from being who I am. I encourage others around me to do the same, so that I can learn what makes them tick, too.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. Give grace.&#xA0;</strong>Give grace to yourself and everyone around you. It&#x2019;s hard to admit sometimes (because I&#x2019;m a recovering perfectionist), but I&#x2019;m not the perfect leader, colleague, dog mom, spouse or friend. But neither are the people I work with. What&#x2019;s important on my team is that we face it together, and we help each other move past whatever is holding us back from being great. No judgments, no political maneuvering. Just straightforward, transparent and honest communication with each other.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

After a sleepless night of coding, with the support of dozens of cups of coffee, beer, pizzas and even professional on-the-house massages, the 200 developers in Tel Aviv put their coding abilities to the test. From social jogging to zombie runners, over 30 apps to help solve local and global problems were conceived in just 24 hours last weekend at Reading 3, a commercial and entertainment district in Tel Aviv.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The winner? Israeli app Socializr puts socializing back in the REAL world instead of the virtual one by keeping people away from their mobile phones with a gamification effect. That&#x2019;s right. We said away.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Developed by Shai Mishali, Pavel Kaminsky and Rotem Tsabary, they pointed out that more and more people are bound to their mobile phones even when they are with their friends. So they developed the Socializr app where a user can challenge his/her friends to avoid checking their mobile phones for a given time. This social game keeps the mobile phones in the pocket and gives friends a chance to interact.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But it also gives back. All the users participating in the game use PayPal to donate any amount of money to a local charity on behalf of the winner of the game.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The second annual Tel Aviv Battle Hack 2014 was judged by&#xA0;<a title=\"GetTaxi&#x2019;s\" href=\"http://www.gettaxi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">GetTaxi&#x2019;s</a>&#xA0;CTO David Drai,&#xA0;<a title=\"Geektime\" href=\"http://www.geektime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Geektime</a>&#xA0;CEO Moran Bar, and SpeedUp Chairman Tal Barnoach.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The runner up was the application Focus, developed by Itay Galim, Shahar Levinstein, and Alik Hochner. The app aimed to stop young people from driving under the influence; the user can test their sobriety by playing a game and sending a video to a friend. The app also proposes a cab calling service.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The Socializr developers will fly to the world finals in San Jose and battle teams from cities like San Francisco, Istanbul, London and Moscow for the grand prize of $100,000 USD.

For iPhone users, you&#x2019;ll see a notification in your Settings tab to do a &#x201C;Phone Verification&#x201D; which basically gives us permission to do the same thing. By allowing your Android and iPhone apps to send a text message to PayPal, we can do a one-time confirmation that lets us know that you own a particular device. This permission helps us prevent fraudulent account takeovers. To be very clear: we only have your permission to send an SMS; we do not have access to read or receive SMS on your behalf.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It&#x2019;s a really fast and easy way to help keep your account secure.

With eBay Inc. hiring over 12,000 employees in the year 2013, it is critical for our GTA teams to follow the same steps for all eBay Inc. entities and locations.

The first two included a majority of the information using Power Points and the live systems to work through examples from the slides.

During the final day, GTA members were allowed to explore and work through the system on their own.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Reactions were extremely positive and everyone was excited to see the new changes and start hiring with the new system. In particular, team members were happy to know they could reach out to any GTA recruiter globally and ask questions about the system because everyone was now under the same structure.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>All in all, we think this was the right step to take for our business.

Now, a variety of local cafes and restaurants &#x2013; and any other participating merchants &#x2013; can offer their customers a walletless transaction. All that&#x2019;s needed is a smartphone and&#xA0;<a title=\"the PayPal app\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paying-with-your-phone-has-never-been-so-easy-or-looked-so-good/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">the PayPal app</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With the new &#x201C;Shops&#x201D; tab, customers show the merchant that they are in their place of business. The merchant sees the customer&#x2019;s profile image and can process the payment via the customer&#x2019;s PayPal account. The customer then receives a confirmation of the amount they paid as well as a receipt.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>This pilot project is another important step towards a cashless future. By this new way of paying, we not only ensure that customers can buy what they want even if they don&#x2019;t have the right amount of cash on them, but also that merchants of all sizes can be an active part of the innovative future of commerce.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Personally, I think PayPal has defined a great new cashless consumer experience making use of your everyday device to make everyday purchases. Special thanks to our team that made this possible.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Currently, Berlin&#x2019;s participating shops and restaurants include&#xA0;<a title=\"Du Bonheur\" href=\"http://www.dubonheur.de/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Du Bonheur</a>, hosskost Berlin,&#xA0;<a title=\"MAKI\" href=\"http://www.makitogo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">MAKI</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"Mogg &amp;amp; Melzer\" href=\"http://www.moggandmelzer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Mogg &amp; Melzer</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"momos\" href=\"http://momos-berlin.de/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">momos</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"Noodeli\" href=\"http://www.noodeli.de/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Noodeli</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"ocelot\" href=\"http://www.ocelot.de/Ocelot-WFS-de_DE-EUR\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">ocelot</a>, Shoenschmecker Deli,&#xA0;<a title=\"The Barn\" href=\"http://barn.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">The Barn</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a title=\"The Barn Roastery\" href=\"http://barn.bigcartel.com/the-roastery\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">The Barn Roastery</a>.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Jan 07, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Walter Hafner, Global Operations, PayPal EMEA</strong><br><br><br>When I joined PayPal five years ago, my main rationale was to work in an international environment. At the time I didn&#x2019;t put too much thought into what motivated me beyond the fact that working abroad is an invaluable experience both from a career and personal perspective.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When preparing for interviews, I read the book&#xA0;<a title=\"The Perfect Store: Inside eBay\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Perfect-Store-Inside-eBay/dp/0316164933\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">The Perfect Store: Inside eBay</a>by Adam Cohen, which talks about eBay&#x2019;s early days and how Pierre Omidyar engaged with the online community of his AuctionWeb platform, which he transformed into a multi-billion dollar business less than a decade later. I was impressed by Pierre&#x2019;s philosophical approach to business and his objective to remove market imperfections through his platform.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But, quite frankly, PayPal in 2009 looked less philosophical. A lot of groundwork had to be done to organize better and to make life easier for customers. The problem? In the constant conflict between time to market and customer experience, people rarely lift their heads up to think about purpose. However, PayPal was committed to improving, and in my humble opinion, we&#x2019;ve come a long way. Today customers are more likely to recommend us, as are our employees &#x2013; and not only because we are a fast growing business which provides job opportunity. Why is that?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">We defined our vision&#x2026;</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>An enormous amount of thought has been put into our organization by our leaders. John Donahoe and David Marcus personally took the time to travel around the globe at the beginning of 2013 to talk about why great companies are built on a shared purpose and define what eBay Inc. wants to stand for in our communities.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The amount of change these presentations caused can&#x2019;t be overstated. I felt valued and proud as an employee due to the fact that our leaders took the time to communicate this message to more than 10,000 employees around the globe&#xA0;<strong style=\"\"><u style=\"\">in person</u></strong>. Hearing John Donahoe talk about eBay founder Pierre Omidyar&#x2019;s vision for our company was inspiring. This was truly a special moment in my career and I am sure a lot of my colleagues feel the same.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">&#x2026;And became a team.</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>The reason I felt this way was because I had trust that the message delivered by John Donahoe and David Marcus was consistent with actions that can be observed. In the same way that PayPal is committed to creating a great customer experience, our leadership team is committed to creating a great employee experience far beyond competitive incentives. For example, over the last five years, I have been able to observe how much rigour has been put into team building and talent development in PayPal Global Operations, and into building not only a customer-centric, but also an employee-centric culture.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A culture that allows for work-life balance and treats remployees like grown-ups who get the job done no matter where they are. A culture that empowers employees to make the right decisions on behalf of our customers. A culture that allows people with different backgrounds to succeed in a truly global company.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A lot of companies have high aspirations regarding their culture but aren&#x2019;t sure how to go about shaping it. For PayPal, it&#x2019;s obvious that that first, powerful step has been building a shared purpose that translates into inspiration. Another recent example that shows PayPal&#x2019;s commitment to bringing our company culture to life: every manager in Global Operations is attending two full days of diversity and inclusion training &#x2013; an investment that underscores how serious our leaders take our culture.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For me, these are all small pieces of a big mosaic coming together which makes me feel I am in the right place. Different to where I was five years ago, today I know I work for PayPal not because it&#x2019;s abroad, but because I have the opportunity to have an impact in a company that aligns with my values. There may still be some pieces missing, but I am excited to be part of a team that is committed to complete the work.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>What has been the most inspiring moment for you at your place of business? Was it reflective of a shared purpose or something else?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Established in 1929 and the flag carrier of Poland, LOT is one of the world&#x2019;s oldest airlines still in operation, and the first Central-Eastern European airline to introduce PayPal payments.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Thanks to this alliance, passengers of the Polish carrier now have the opportunity to make secure and fast online payments from almost anywhere in the world with any internet-enabled device.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A key destination for LOT is, of course, Poland, a country with a population of 38.5 million. Interestingly, another 19 million Poles live abroad, accounting for more than a third of the entire world&#x2019;s Polish population; the majority of these Poles reside in the U.S., explaining why 3% of US citizens can speak Polish.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For this reason at least, travelling is extremely important for Polish people, and what better way than flying to cover the miles to see your family and friends?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While PayPal reaches 137 million PayPal users worldwide, LOT Polish Airlines allows people to travel to a complex network of&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOT_Polish_Airlines_destinations\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">60 destinations</a>in many parts of the world. Accordingly, customers using the PayPal-integrated&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.lot.com/us/en/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">lot.com</a>&#xA0;website are able to purchase airline tickets in multiple currencies, from each of the 193 countries where PayPal operates.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When planning your trip to Poland, don&#x2019;t miss the opportunity to visit its major cities (LOT Polish Airlines offer direct flights to most of them).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Warsaw, for example is now a modern and rich city that particularly inspires young people. Or, for those searching for a unique mixture of the colorful past and the vibrant present, Cracow offers an extensive list of museums and cinemas. If you&#x2019;re looking to get a taste of authentic revolution, Gdansk&#x2019;s thousand-years&#x2019; worth of history, its location at the crossroads of important commercial and communication routes, and extensive port and mercantile traditions, make it a great meeting place of many cultures, nationalities and religions.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>All these Polish hot spots and more are even easier to discover now that LOT Polish Airlines flight tickets can be bought with PayPal. So have a great flight &#x2013; if not to Poland directly, then at least have an intellectual trip to the topics related to this amazing country!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

The tough part?

While good legs are still necessary to chew uphill miles, mobile technologies can help monitor our progress and our fitness status, and keep us in touch with the rest of the world.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">And how did Amani land on your radar?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While researching a non-profit partner for our Kilimanjaro trek, I wanted to identify an organization that was deeply involved with the local community, while developing a plan for sustainable growth. These are often the ingredients for a successful path.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Amani, which received a grant from the eBay Foundation last year, has been successfully operating for over 10 years in Tanzania and its model (to support street children with in-house programs and then fully reintegrate them into their families or communities) is being adopted by other organizations.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While relatively small, Amani is currently providing support to over 200 children every year and is planning to open a new welcome center in 2014.

We even accepted donations and made payments on the trek above 10,000ft.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We also used other technologies from&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://kilitechtrek.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">KiliTechTrek</a>&#xA0;sponsors such as GoalZero (a leading provider of portable solar panels), Eye-Fi (Maker of WiFi memory cards that automatically transfer photos to mobile device), and Runtastic (producer of mobile solutions to track fitness and sport activities).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>There is no better sight than seeing a geeky group playing with and enjoying cool technologies while doing good!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">How would you say mobile adoption has gone in Tanzania, and what does that say about technology overall?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Like Tanzania, most African countries have literally taken a fast track on the development cycle of the telecom and Internet infrastructure and embraced wireless as their baseline platforms from day one. This spearheaded the diffusion of both basic and advanced mobile services, as it has been the case for the world-famous mobile money transfer service M-Pesa, which allows villages from remote areas to immediately enter and participate into the wider economic cycle.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While connectivity remains far from ubiquitous, it is also allowing the emergence of new models in the field of education where, for example, new topics can be taught and knowledge can be shared across a wider network of education centers.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What were the gaps you and your group found along the way? If you could create a Jetsons-like wish list for the technological world, what would be on it?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We certainly experienced some gaps in connectivity &#x2013; a very remote area especially at high elevation doesn&#x2019;t necessarily see the same human traffic as in an urban setting &#x2013; therefore the regular social media peeking was less at hand. We had a good support in terms of checking our health status, yet I do believe there is ample room for preventative monitoring of conditions in such an oxygen deprived and harsh environment.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We also definitely missed the comfort of our favorite food and I wonder if drones will help overcome some of this in the future.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What&#x2019;s next for Summit Stories, and also, where do you see an opportunity for technology to improve an existing process? What areas of our life can technology still summit?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Summit Stories&#x2019; next expedition will be to Nepal this April: a group of technophiles will trek to Everest Base Camp to fundraise for a local non-profit while using technologies along the way.

From discovery to offers to checkout, and from loyalty programs to ordering, fulfillment, and even returns, there are incredible opportunities to eliminate unnecessary friction points and unlock information that can make shopping experiences faster, or more fun, or more personal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The receipt is a good example. The printed paper record of past purchases seems necessary. Without it, how would you establish proof of payment for a particular item or service?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But there&#x2019;s something about it that also makes it feel like an unwelcome remnant of an old way of doing things. Is there any more obvious bit of friction in the entire purchasing process than the wad of receipts stuffed in your wallet? Merchants offer them mostly in case evidence of purchase is required at some later date for anything from returns to expense reports to taxes, depending on where you are in the world. As consumers, we hold onto them because we have to, not because we want to.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Still, there are those who suggest that the receipt is a hidden vein of untapped data that can somehow be mined to influence future shopping decisions. And while receipts do contain information about where and when customers shop and how much they pay that hints at further insights about purchasing preferences and patterns, I believe its value as a predictor of future behavior is sharply limited. Rather than an indicator of what consumers are likely to do down the road, receipts are useful mostly as a way to retrace the path they followed in the past.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In this way, receipts are a little like the fossilized dinosaur tracks that paleontologists have found preserved near ancient bodies of water: while they offer tantalizing indirect evidence of past activities, they tell us only a very modest amount about the habits, personalities, or needs of the creatures that left them, and nothing about what they did in the minutes, months, or years after they left their footprints behind.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For merchants, it&#x2019;s where consumers are going next &#x2013; and why they&#x2019;re going there &#x2013; that really matters. To create the kind of complete portrait of an individual that can drive deeper engagement and more lasting loyalty, it takes more than just the location, time, and price of past purchases. Much richer indications of future intentions can be found in the clues people offer when they click on a jacket while browsing online or pick up a pair of pants off the rack at a store. New web tracking technology, new in-store beacons, new tools like something called &#x201C;dwell time analytics&#x201D; tie these together with the record of past purchases contained in a receipt, and you begin to get the kind of complete picture of a consumer&#x2019;s needs and wants that can truly transform the relationship between a retailer and its customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The key here, though, is the concept of individual identity. The potential for customers and retailers to connect in more meaningful and human ways is very powerful, but whether this potential is fulfilled will ultimately depend on how much information consumers choose to share about their preferences and desires. In the end, this will be a matter of trust. Is information and financial data safe and secure? Is privacy respected? Is real value offered in return for the information that is shared? Is shopping truly made more convenient or more fun?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>These are the questions that we ask every day at PayPal and the principles that we&#x2019;re focused on. And while the receipt can certainly play a useful role as an artifact of past shopping activity, to create the kind of long-term relationship that people prefer and merchants seek, a much broader view of is required.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

It was great to go on record with my thoughts about key trends affecting payments. And the blog prompted some fascinating conversations about how technology is transforming shopping experiences.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Last year I highlighted four &#x201C;thought starters&#x201D;&#x2014;the continuing lack of adoption of NFC technology at the cash register; the merger of payments, loyalty programs, and coupons; the rise of mobile cash registers, and the beginning of location-aware, context-relevant shopping and payment experiences. The reality of 2013 wasn&#x2019;t too far off&#x2026; so I decided to give it another shot this year.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>My job at PayPal gives me a unique opportunity to work with peers and strategize with partners across many industries about solving real problems and delivering exciting new experiences for consumers and retailers. That leads to a pretty privileged view into what&#x2019;s coming next.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So here are my predictions for 2014:<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1. Traditional retail fights back</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>In recent years, technology innovation from companies has disrupted traditional retail by making it easy for consumers to browse in a store and then buy online at the cheapest possible price. It&#x2019;s a practice called &#x201C;showrooming&#x201D; and in-store merchants understandably hate it. This year, retailers will start leveraging and converting their retail footprint into logistical assets to enable shoppers to buy anywhere they want: in-store, on mobile, and on the web, and get fast-delivery, or pick-up in store the same day. Local will be more important than ever &#x2013; and from our perspective we couldn&apos;t be more excited about innovations like&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paypal-beacon-finally-an-easier-way-to-pay-in-stores-than-swiping-a-credit-card/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal Beacon</a>&#xA0;which will transform the retail environment for your local main street by bringing back opportunities for personalized service all driven by mobile.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Mobile will transform commerce forever</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>If you work for a payment technology company, this prediction won&#x2019;t be a surprise. But many consumers are just beginning to experience the freedom, flexibility, and fun of mobile payments and shopping, and they&#x2019;re going to want more. This will lead to a flood of new payment experiences built on technologies such as sensors, geolocation, and the cloud that will soon make standing in a long checkout line and paying with a card seem like something out of the Stone Age.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. iOS and Android will drive a retail revolution</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Last year, I predicted the beginning of the end of the fixed-location cash register in favor of mobile checkout technology. In 2014, the entire retail infrastructure will follow suit. And why not! In less than four years since the launch of the iPad, tablets have become a fixture of our everyday lives. This year, they&#x2019;ll become a standard tool in retail environments too, and merchants will use them for everything from Point of Sale to inventory, fulfillment, customer relationship management, and more.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">4. Bitcoin will continue to gain ground (but not as a currency)</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Bitcoin will continue to attract more people as a store of value and a speculative investment asset. I predict that the value of Bitcoin still has the potential to double (as of December 11, 2013 at 8:08 AM PT: 1 BTC = 915 USD) by the same time next year. But I believe it will have a hard time becoming mainstream as a currency, due to its expected continued volatility amidst regulation authorities and governments figuring out what to make of the cryptocurrency.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">5. The year of disruption . . .</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>I love disruption&#x2014;it&#x2019;s when rules get broken and new ideas are born and tested that things get interesting. This trend has been gathering momentum over the last year or so as smaller players in the payments industry power a wave of startups that use mobile payments to fuel segment-transforming new business models. (Full disclosure: PayPal recently acquired Braintree, which provides the payment technology engine behind disruptive startups like Uber, Airbnb, and OpenTable.)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In 2014, you&#x2019;ll see larger payments entities scramble to accelerate the pace of their innovation to catch up to these smaller and more nimble competitors. Meanwhile, smaller players will scramble to achieve the scale and experience needed to compete in a global business. As a result, billions of dollars will be at play in the payment industry, and 2014 will be a year of game-changing disruption.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">6. . . . and consolidation in the payments industry</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our industry has a lot of players. Too many. No doubt there&#x2019;s a ton of great innovation out there, but a lot of it works better in combination than on its own. And some of today&#x2019;s bright young firms will never achieve the scale to survive without joining forces with someone bigger. This will lead to a wave of acquisitions in 2014. Meanwhile, new alliances will create intriguing partnerships that span payments, retail, and more. It simply won&#x2019;t be the same industry in 12 months that it is today.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So that&#x2019;s where I see payments headed in 2014. If you think there are other trends that I missed, I&#x2019;d love to hear your thoughts. And whether you agree or disagree with my thought starters, I think we can all agree that this industry is in the midst of incredible and exciting change right now. It&#x2019;s going to be an amazing ride over the next 12 months.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

The overwhelming scale of this yearly gathering of the retail industry makes it an occasion that can&#x2019;t be missed if you care about the fast-changing world of shopping and selling.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Last year&#x2019;s Big Show marked a pivotal moment for PayPal as we showcased our move into the offline world with the announcement that consumers could pay for their purchases with PayPal at&#xA0;<a title=\"18,000 merchant locations across the United States\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/commerce/paypal-now-at-18-000-retail-locations-in-the-u-s-including-places-where-you-shop-every-day/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">18,000 merchant locations across the United States</a>. We&#x2019;ve enjoyed an incredibly busy and successful year since then. During 2013, thanks to our collaboration with Discover and merchant acquiring partners, and through our direct relationships with U.S. retailers, 1.9 million merchant locations in the U.S. have now committed to accept PayPal payments. We also launched our&#xA0;<a title=\"new PayPal app\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paying-with-your-phone-has-never-been-so-easy-or-looked-so-good/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">new PayPal app</a>, announced&#xA0;<a title=\"PayPal Beacon\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paypal-beacon-finally-an-easier-way-to-pay-in-stores-than-swiping-a-credit-card/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal Beacon</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a title=\"payment code\" href=\"http://https//www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/paypal-introduces-the-world-to-payment-code-at-money2020/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">payment code</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"acquired Braintree\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/braintree-has-officially-joined-paypal/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">acquired Braintree</a>, and much more.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Every one of these steps was designed to serve a much larger purpose. Our goal is to deliver shopping experiences that are more convenient, more personal, and more fun for consumers, and more profitable for merchants by making it easier to shop and pay from anywhere and at any time &#x2013; in-store during regular shopping hours, or on a mobile device, tablet, or PC from your office, your bed, while you&#x2019;re riding the bus, or any place else you can imagine.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Seamless Online Checkout</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This year, we&#x2019;ll accelerate the pace of innovation as we continue to lead the push to transform the shopping experience by delivering greater value to merchants and their customers. At NRF 2014 we&#x2019;re showcasing advances that are already making the future of retail today&#x2019;s reality for many retailers, starting with a completely redesigned online checkout experience for large merchants. Now, when customers pay with PayPal online, the entire checkout experience can happen entirely within the merchant website, in a process that takes just a few seconds and requires fewer steps than before. In addition, merchants only need to do one integration to get the same seamless checkout experience on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here&apos;s a peek at how it works:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;re currently piloting this new checkout experience with a few partners and we&#x2019;ll make it more generally available to large merchants during the first half of this year. Of course we plan to roll it out to small and medium sized merchants very soon as well.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Later this year, merchants will be able to do one integration to get Log In with PayPal functionality as part of the new online checkout experience, enabling consumers to log into a merchant&#x2019;s website with PayPal instead of creating another username and password. Merchants get to know their customers better and consumers get a much easier checkout experience when shopping on a merchant&#x2019;s site. If you are logged in and check out, all of your shipping, preferences and payment information is automatically populated. All you need to do is click the checkout button and you&apos;re done.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Mobile Commerce Comes to the Store with Payment Code and Beacon</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;re also focused on delivering innovative ways for merchants to take full advantage of the power of mobile devices within their food service and retail locations. One example is the recent announcement of payment code, a technology that enables consumers to use a QR code or four-digit short code to pay in-store using a smartphone.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At NRF 2014, we&#x2019;re also announcing that we&#x2019;ve been working closely with MICROS and Discover to make payment code available to their merchants. Starting in February, many MICROS and Discover merchants will be able to upgrade software in existing terminals, via a small integration, to accept payments from customers who want to pay with PayPal using their smartphones, either by scanning a QR code or entering a four-digit short code into a PIN pad.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I am pleased to share that payment code is already available at more than 1,500 locations in the UK. Additionally, it is available as a payment method across hundreds of taxis in Canberra, Australia, with the goal to rollout to thousands more by mid 2014.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here&#x2019;s how it works:<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&#x2019;m also thrilled to share a quick update on PayPal Beacon, which has been one of the industry&#x2019;s hottest topics since we announced it in September. Right now, we&#x2019;re testing it at a few merchant locations in the U.S. and Australia, and soon we&#x2019;ll start testing with additional merchants in the U.K., Canada, France, and Germany.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;re hard at work integrating Beacon into the PayPal app, and we expect to complete that work early in 2014, at which point we will be excited to begin making this next-generation shopping experience available to consumers. So, if you want to be among the first merchants to offer the kind of hands-free, highly personal experience that only Beacon can provide &#x2013; or to help us test Beacon &#x2013; please visit&#xA0;<a title=\"www.paypal.com/beacon\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/beacon\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">www.paypal.com/beacon</a>&#xA0;to learn more.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Connect with PayPal at the Big Show</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&#x2019;m thrilled to be in New York for NRF 2014 for another reason: it&#x2019;s a great place to catch up with colleagues, partners, and friends from across the industry, and an ideal opportunity to make new connections and share ideas and hear feedback.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>If you&#x2019;re in New York for the Big Show, please stop by the PayPal booth (#4245) to say hello.

Without question, we&#x2019;re entering a period of far-reaching disruption that will revolutionize money. We believe that most of this disruption will be driven by innovative payment technologies that make shopping experiences meaningfully faster, easier, more fun, and more personal for consumers, and significantly more valuable for merchants.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Separately, PayPal and Braintree have been at the forefront of a wave of advances that have fueled big changes in how people shopped during the last 12 to 18 months.

Many developers are already using both Braintree and PayPal technologies in their mobile apps. For example, we recently announced that Uber is the first Braintree merchant to integrate the new PayPal Mobile SDK.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Looking back, the combination of PayPal and Braintree seems almost inevitable.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Dec 23, 2013<br><strong style=\"\">Wayne Wang, Head of Corporate Communications, PayPal China</strong><br><br>We&#x2019;re excited to announce that we&#x2019;ve just inked a strategic deal with Beijing Post &#x2013; one of China&#x2019;s largest postal providers, serving customers in more than 204 cities in 143 countries worldwide. The company is also the proud owner of the largest international mail exchange office in China.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Why is this a big deal? Currently in China traditional exporters are seeing continuous decline but cross-border e-commerce is booming. As such, more and more exporting merchants have started to embrace online and ship products internationally. In 2012, China&#x2019;s freight import and exports totaled USD 2.3 trillion, up 32%, surpassing the U.S. for the first time. Any successful e-commerce merchant knows the importance of getting logistics right when it comes to getting their goods into the customer&#x2019;s hands. Speed of delivery, service quality and the ability to track goods are vital to any seller that wants to have a competitive edge.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For this reason we&#x2019;re delighted to announce that together with Beijing Post we&#x2019;ve created&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">PayPal Package</strong>, an international logistics solution. First up, PayPal Package allows merchants to track order delivery online, which means it enables merchants to be covered by our seller protection policy. Second, merchants can benefit from an international delivery service for small parcels, which guarantees that these items will be boarding a plane for delivery on the day of order. Current estimates show that transporting parcels from China to the US and Europe takes 10 &#x2013; 20 days and with this new arrangement we will improve the overall shipping experience. Working with Beijing Post, our merchants in China will benefit from its mature import-export system and, ultimately, the speed of an express delivery service for the price of surface mail.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We know that one of the reasons people prefer PayPal for international shopping is because it makes buying things simple and fast. But if it takes weeks to get your goods, or a logistical slip-up means you don&#x2019;t receive them at all, customer satisfaction plummets. At PayPal we&#x2019;re always looking for practical innovations which make shopping better for both merchants and consumers, and we we&#x2019;re pretty confident that PayPal Package does just that.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

There&apos;s so much added convenience in paying our bills at any hour of the day/night and getting in and out of checkout lines with greater speed and ease. This all works because we trust that the privacy and secrecy of the information we provide will remain safe and secure.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Jan 14, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Carolyn Groobey, Vice President, Global Products, PayPal</strong><br><br>I have spent a lot of time on the road this past year talking to small and medium businesses, and one of the top questions I receive from these merchants when it comes to payments and shopping is, &#x201C;How can I make an investment in a POS that fits me and my goals?&#x201D; Sometimes this simply means accepting a credit card, allowing customers to shop with a mobile device, or offering customers loyalty and rewards. From our perspective, we alone cannot do all of this and we collaborate closely with like-minded companies that share our vision for making payments simple.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Small wonder, then, that small businesses are flocking to the new generation of tablet-based POS systems. Now, for less than US $1,000, you can have a sophisticated mobile point of sale system (mPOS) that includes a tablet, card reader, cash drawer, receipt printer, and advanced software for managing every aspect of a business, from inventory management to check out. Among other things, that means you can be up and running in minutes.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>There are a lot of reasons why this is a particularly exciting and interesting transformation. One is that not only does it level the playing field between large enterprise retailers and small local merchants in a dramatic way, but it also creates huge opportunities for small businesses to develop disruptive new business models that can offer a significant competitive edge. Another is that it happened really fast &#x2013; a year ago, it was a cool oddity to stumble into a shop that used a tablet in place of a cash register. Today it&#x2019;s pretty normal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And third, the entire mPOS setup is built on a lot of intriguing innovation that comes from a wide variety of sources &#x2013; hardware manufacturers, software developers, app designers, payment networks, and more. Pulling it all together into a more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system that&#x2019;s affordable, powerful, and easy to use requires partnership and collaboration across an unusually broad array of companies.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At PayPal, we&#x2019;re a key player in the ongoing process of innovation and collaboration that is powering a new generation of experiences designed to make shopping faster, easier, and more fun for consumers and more profitable for retailers. The mPOS systems transforming the retail landscape are a great example. Our PayPal Here app is a key ingredient because it enables merchants to accept any form of payment while providing other essential capabilities, like fraud protection. But we knew we couldn&#x2019;t build the kind of comprehensive mPOS system that we were picturing &#x2013; and that small retailers want &#x2013; without the help and expertise of a host of other organizations that share our vision.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So we&#x2019;ve been working with some of the world&#x2019;s most interesting and innovative companies to bring everything together, including&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.booker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Booker</a>,<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.bouncepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Bouncepad</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://erply.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">ERPLY</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://hecklerdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Heckler Design</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.leaf.me/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Leaf</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.leapset.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Leapset</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.magtek.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">MagTek</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.micros.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">MICROS</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ncrsilver.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">NCR Silver</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://revelsystems.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Revel Systems</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.shopkeep.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">ShopKeep POS</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"https://shopventory.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Shopventory</a>,&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.touchbistro.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Touch Bistro</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.vendhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Vend</a>. These partners understand the issues that small businesses face and the opportunities for growth that a new generation of shopping experiences can deliver. Now any retailer can easily find a complete, affordable package that meets the specific needs of their business &#x2013; everything from tablets, card readers, stands, and receipt printers to the software needed to run a retail environment, the apps to engage customers in ways that are more effective and more personal, and the network and infrastructure to accept any and all kinds of payments.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>mPOS systems are just one example of what great collaboration can lead to. This week at NRF, we&#x2019;ve announced that we have working with MICROS to enable their merchants to accept payments from their customers using a smartphone and either a QR code or four-digit short code. And we&#x2019;re working with software developers and many of the mPOS companies we are working with to bring PayPal Beacon &#x2013; our new technology that offers consumers a completely hands-free way to pay &#x2013; to stores in 2014<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This week&#x2019;s NRF show in New York is a great place to see what can happen when innovative companies with a shared vision for how technology can transform payments and shopping work together. If you happen to be attending NRF 2014, please stop by booth #4245 to learn more about how you can collaborate with us and to see some of these great technologies in action. If you don&#x2019;t make it to NRF this week and would like to learn more, please feel free to email my team at&#xA0;<a href=\"mailto:POSpartners@paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">POSpartners@paypal.com.</a><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

However, eBay Inc. is made up of several different business units, spanning eBay, PayPal, eBay Enterprise, StubHub, and many others. Like many organizations, we have a number of initiatives going on to share data across the company to drive better results. Some of these were&#xA0;<a title=\"on display\" href=\"http://blog.ebay.com/ebay-inc-at-nrf-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">on display</a>&#xA0;at the National Retail Federation&#x2019;s annual big show, where this year&#x2019;s theme was &#x201C;Elevated Insight.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When it comes to elevated insight, our Social Innovation strategy is no exception. At eBay Inc., one of our three key areas of impact is powering charitable giving. Our approach to charitable giving is grounded in what we do best &#x2013; technology-enabled commerce. We&#x2019;re working to extend our business models to create a worldwide network for good that inspires everyone &#x2013; whether individuals, nonprofits or global brands &#x2013; to take action.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Through an increasingly global and diverse portfolio of businesses, as well as cutting-edge tools that enable anytime, anywhere transactions, our approach to powering charitable giving is three-fold:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Connect people with easy ways to support the causes they care about</li><li style=\"\">Enable nonprofits to raise mission-critical funds and connect with donors in new ways</li><li style=\"\">Offer innovative ways for retail partners and celebrities to extend their positive impact</li></ul>Our long-term goal is to power the world&#x2019;s largest platform for charitable giving. In 2013 we made public commitments towards that end. By 2015 we plan to double the number of customers that take action on behalf of a charity through our giving programs and platforms; to double the total value of funds raised generated for charitable organizations through our giving programs and platforms; and to double the number of charities that benefit from our giving programs and platforms.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&#x2019;ve been part of the eBay Inc. family long enough to be able to say that at least within the Social Innovation realm, it was not that long ago that our business units were working in functional data silos. I remember one case in point where two business units were not aware that each of them were simultaneously working on a cause-related initiative with the same benefiting nonprofit, missing opportunities to maximize impact and reach.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But I can also unequivocally say that these days we have broken down those silos and operate as one company. We&#x2019;ve taken action to intentionally break up our Social Innovation teams and spread individuals throughout the business units in the company. And with activities ranging from yearly Social Innovation summits to share best practices, to the development of company-wide &#x201C;Cause dashboards&#x201D; from our enormous data warehouse that aggregate information across initiatives, to bi-weekly meetings with our global teammates to simply stay in sync, it is evident that we are doing things much better today. For example, when the eBay business unit runs an experiment to calculate the value of a donor&#x2019;s location when determining a relevant charity to put in front of that person when they are checking out on our site, the PayPal team knows it and can act accordingly to determine how to adjust relevance algorithms on their side to create more relevant experiences for all of our customers and drive engagement with more charities.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>By way of PayPal, eBay, StubHub and the rest of our global portfolio, we&#x2019;re pioneering new, disruptive giving solutions that take advantage of each business&#x2019;s unique assets to rally our customers in support of charitable causes. As we jointly work to drive the next generation of commerce, we&#x2019;re committed to building a future that enables and inspires charitable giving at a scale never seen before. With hundreds of millions of users and the trust that comes with processing billions of dollars in donations for nonprofits around the world, we think we can make a pretty good start.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">*This article originally appeared on&#xA0;<a title=\"Markets for Good\" href=\"http://www.marketsforgood.org/the-integration-of-cause-related-work-into-business/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Markets for Good</a></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

No other payments competitor has achieved PayPal&#x2019;s success &#x2013; because no other competitor has a commerce platform like eBay.

Being part of eBay Inc. gives PayPal access to an enormously valuable global customer base; it provides a source of low-cost capital that lets us aggressively fund growth and innovation in areas such as mobile and credit, as well as helping us acquire companies such as Braintree to enhance our competitive position. And being part of eBay Inc. enables us to broadly leverage the company&#x2019;s technology capabilities, data, commerce platforms and relationships with retailers, brands and large merchants worldwide.

Back in Miami for a second year, the crowd proved once again that the City is a strong, up-and-coming hub of technology and innovation, as well as the bridge between the U.S. and Latin America.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the end, a few familiar faces took home first place with&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Once</strong>, an innovative app aimed at bringing families together to build out a family savings plan. Two members of Team Once were also winners of our 2013 Miami Battle Hack. Osniel Gonzalez and Jose Pimienta, and new third team member Rafael Bonnelly, are now set to join the other city champions at our Silicon Valley World Finals to compete for the $100,000 grand prize.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Incorporating a fun lottery-style component, the&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Once app</strong>&#xA0;works by having a maximum of 11 family members join together to contribute to a 12-month savings plan. Each month, one family member is picked as the &#x201C;monthly winner,&#x201D; and receives that month&#x2019;s full contributions. Throughout the year, every contributor will win a month to get the money, but it may be at any given time.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our second place winner was&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">#YOLO For a Cause</strong>, created by Waldemar Figueroa, Javier Velazquez, Antonio Rodriguez and Jorge Suarez. The #Yolo app is where viral video challenges meet charitable donations. You can use the service to dare your friends to do something, like the dreaded cinnamon challenge, putting up a bet for them to take a part of. When the challenge takes place, a portion of the proceeds goes to a charity of your choosing.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Code Together</strong>&#xA0;took third place, developed by Gianni D&apos;Alerta, Deborah Venuti, Dan Vera, and Joshua Martinez. Helping the local events scene, the app gives event organizers and sponsors a centralized and easy way to create events in local cities. One of the most impressive parts of the app is its l33t point integration given out through participating, allowing organizers to see how much sponsors are actually participating in events before taking them on as partners. Overall, the teams battled heavily throughout the night, with a trusty Keurig machine in heavy rotation, and brought home a tremendous array of hacks ranging from TSA mailing packages (in case you forgot that prohibited item in your carry-on), to an application that allowed you to track sign language through a Leap Motion device and translate it as needed for interaction with those with disabilities.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Miami already has a strong sense of identity in the South Florida community, and these hackers were the shining example of everything that makes Miami great.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Our animals are shown love not only by staff, but by our amazing volunteers who devote their time to care for them. They not only walk them, but have them groomed, take them into their homes for sleepovers, take them on day trips like hiking or take them out for ice cream. Our barn animals are our beautiful pastures and roam free and live naturally the way a farm animal should. During the warm months, our dogs enjoy the outdoors by living in large kennel spaces with sprinkler systems, doggie pools, play yards and a large dog walk trail. During the winter season, our dogs have sufficient kennel space with kuranda beds and comforters to keep them cozy and warm. Our cats live freely in a cage free, two-story colonial home.

The winner for the Battle of the Bay? An app called&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Ledgr</strong>.

We&#x2019;re excited to share that starting Monday, February 24, Uber will offer PayPal as a payment option to its UK users and our mobile SDK will be generally available to developers in more than 30 markets (more to follow on Monday!). Our new mobile SDK builds on our belief that developers need the freedom to innovate for customers, instead of worrying about the complexities with payments.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With our new mobile SDK, developers can get key features such as:<br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Future payments</span>: Once customers link their PayPal account to the developers&#x2019; app, they don&#x2019;t have to login to their account every time they want to pay with PayPal.</li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Native user experience</span>: Developers can provide a seamless payments experience so that their customers aren&#x2019;t redirected to another page to pay with PayPal.</li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Accept credit cards and PayPal*</span>: For developers, it&#x2019;s also one simple integration to accept both PayPal and credit card payments in their app.</li></ul>As the largest, most trusted global payments company around the globe, we believe nobody can grow with a developer&#x2019;s business the way that PayPal can.

        "title": "Three Trends That Might Transform the Retail Payments Experience",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">April 16, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">David Marcus, President, PayPal</strong><br><br>At PayPal I have the opportunity to see a lot of new technologies before they&apos;re ready for prime time. Some we create, others are created by other companies in various industries. I do my best to save enough time away from the corporate side of the job to spend as much time as&#xA0;I can geeking out on these new technologies and charting the future with our amazing teams. Lately, I&apos;ve been looking at three technologies that might truly change the retail experience as we know it.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The Advent of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&apos;ve written about this in the past, but the proliferation of BLE chips in devices will enable the industry to create very precise, fast, and secure shopping and payment experiences that are both location and context relevant. We&apos;re big fans of BLE at PayPal &#x2013; so much so that we created our own Beacon.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/beacon\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">PayPal Beacon</a>&#xA0;is different from other beacons because it&apos;s connected to the Internet, enabling you to pay hands-free even when your phone data connection is poor or non-existent. I truly believe that in a lot of shopping environments, we shouldn&apos;t line up to pay at a specific location. We should be able to grab what we want and go. Beacons combined with our nearly 150 million active customers should enable that at scale as we roll this technology out.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">NFC HCE</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For years I&apos;ve been saying&#xA0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">NFC</a>&#xA0;was a technology in search of a problem, designed and embraced by companies thinking about their own interests<span style=\"\">&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>rather than solving a problem for consumers. Year after year, at the Mobile World Congress, the industry has been issuing press releases about the advent of NFC the following year. And year after year, I&apos;ve been very vocal about NFC not becoming mainstream. So far I&apos;ve been right. Have you ever seen a consortium of mobile carriers, banks, OEMs, and associations, who each want a piece of the action delivering a good consumer product experience? Me neither. The crux of the issue of the original approach of NFC was the Secure Element. The Secure Element, as its name indicates, is meant to keep financial information secure. The problem? Everybody keeps fighting over who gets to control it, because the entity that controls it becomes the toll master for every transaction that takes place. This led to interesting battles between financial institutions, OEMs, and carriers. And this is main reason why Google Wallet on NFC only launched on the Sprint network. The other carriers wanted their own solution, ISIS, to be the only one available to their subscribers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But something changed late last year. The Android team at Google started supporting and pushing another standard (not exclusively for payments) called NFC HCE, or Host Card Emulation. The beauty with this move is that it doesn&apos;t require the whole industry fighting over control for the Secure Element. The Android team approached us with this initiative late last year to collect our feedback on implementation. For the first time ever, I saw a glimmer of hope for NFC in some shopping configurations. Those where you need to be at a specific place in the store to pay &#x2014; think multilane grocery vs. the Apple Store experience of paying wherever you are. Two more events are worth noting. One is the accelerated pace to move to EMV &#x2014; chip and PIN vs. mag stripe on a card &#x2014; since the major credit card breaches with large retailers, which will lead to more NFC-enabled terminals by 2016. And the second one is Visa embracing the HCE approach. It&apos;s worth noting that our approach to security is somewhat different,&#xA0;as we don&apos;t share your financial information when you shop.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The bottom line is that I&apos;m moving from being a massive skeptic of NFC, to being cautiously optimistic on NFC HCE take-up in very specific shopping use cases. But I still passionately believe that paying hands-free through a BLE Beacon and notifying the merchant you&apos;re in the store through that method will enable more transformative experiences for consumers and retailers alike.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Smartwatches and Wearables</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We live in a world of notifications. Apps of all kinds are fighting for our attention all day. And one of the things that struck me after playing with smartwaches quite a bit, is how it is the absolute best device for managing and responding to notifications. For example, we have a pilot running in our on-campus cafe&#xA0;that combines Beacon, with an app built for the Samsung Galaxy Gear 2, and Gear Fit devices. Walk into the area covered by the Beacon, your watch notifies you you&apos;ve checked in, the barista greets you by name because your photo shows up on the point-of-sale system, and when she rings you up, you get another push notification. Tap on the watch to confirm the payment, and go. This is one of the most transformative payments experiences I&apos;ve had. No wallet. The phone never leaves my pocket. And I&apos;m in control.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the next 2 years, I believe we&apos;re going to see more and better smartwatches hit the market (maybe a major new one this year?), and I&apos;m now convinced the Swiss watch industry is going to be in trouble. And it pains me, being a lover of beautiful automatic watches. But the utility and functionality of smartwatches will be a tsunami for that industry if they don&apos;t adapt very quickly. All smartwatches will have a Bluetooth Low Energy, some may have NFC, which combined might make these devices the ultimate in-store payment instrument.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So will it be one technology winning over another? No. This is not, and has never been, about technology. It&apos;s about building amazing shopping experiences reinforcing the human connection in the retail environment. It&apos;s about combining a digital wallet in the cloud with whatever technology makes sense in the right context, and keeping customers safe at all times.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>These are very, very exciting times where we get to redefine how hundreds of millions of people will move to the digital age of money. I can&apos;t wait to unleash some of these great products and innovations to our customers around the world.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

It&#x2019;s giving couch-shopping a whole new meaning. From the comfort of the couch, moms will check-in with the PayPal app on their phone, they love taking advantage of the $8 offer PayPal applies towards their purchase, and I can ring up all the items on their shopping list in minutes.

        "publishDate": "2015-05-26T07:00:00.000Z",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">March 13, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Tomer Barel, Chief Risk Officer, PayPal</strong><br><br><br>Following&#xA0;<a title=\"my post in September\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-and-crowdfunding/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">my post in September</a>, I wanted to update everyone on the changes that we have put in place to address the problems around PayPal limiting the accounts of a few people who were using crowdfunding sites to support their ideas.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>First, let me take a step back and explain the core of the issue. Crowdfunding is fundamentally different from regular ecommerce. There is a distinction between crowdfunding and &#x201C;preselling&#x201D;. In crowdfunding, the process involves speculatively supporting a new concept that may, despite the best of intentions, not make it to market. In &#x201C;preselling&#x201D; there is an expectation that you will get something tangible for your money&#x2026;even if it takes months for delivery.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Many crowdfunding sites allow their campaign owners to pull money out before they have reached the final goal in order to begin creating and funding the concept, a process that often begins even while the crowdfunding process using PayPal is continuing. If it is not made clear that there is no guarantee of product delivery, this can cause regulatory and risk issues (and upset customers) when the final goal isn&#x2019;t reached.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here are some of the key changes we have made to help make sure this doesn&#x2019;t happen:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal has started to engage crowdfunding campaign owners early on to clearly understand their campaign goals and help them ensure their campaigns are compliant with our policies and government regulations.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Together with the crowdfunding sites, we identify if campaigns are strictly fundraising or preselling merchandise. We enable their campaigns without interrupting payments under the condition that the campaign owner is explicit and transparent to their contributors that there is no guarantee of delivery regarding the rewards being offered upon contribution.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>You can read more about the changes&#xA0;<a title=\"here\" href=\"https://www.paypal-businesscenter.com/content/crowdfunding-help-successful-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">here</a>. We worked with the major crowdfunding players to put this solution in place in order to avoid unnecessary account limitations. Daryl Hatton, CEO of FundRazr, one of our largest crowdfunding partners, just posted on&#xA0;<a title=\"the FundRazr blog\" href=\"http://blog.fundrazr.com/fundrazr-news/crowdfunding-policies/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">the FundRazr blog</a>&#xA0;with his perspectives.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Over the last few months, these changes have allowed us to help thousands of campaigns build momentum and focus on their fundraising goals without interruption.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Currently, PayPal is the only payment company that has customized its policy and processes to specifically support crowdfunding and we have done it without changes to our price structure. Providing a lower price point than our competitors is also important to us because PayPal&apos;s very essence is in connecting people. The last thing we want to do is get in the way of the innovative new products coming from entrepreneurs raising money via crowdfunding.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ll continue to keep a close eye on these processes and work with our customers in order to improve our ability to provide a streamlined process to support crowdfunding campaigns. We will continue building strategic partnerships with crowdfunding platforms like FundRazr to make it even easier to offer flexible, safe, and secure payment options so that it is simple for people with great ideas and important causes to raise money.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As always, if you have questions or concerns about a crowdfunding campaign, please contact me directly at&#xA0;<a href=\"mailto:tbarel@paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">tbarel@paypal.com</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Samsung Galaxy S5 users will be the first to use their fingerprint to login to shop at any merchant that accepts PayPal on mobile and in-stores &#x2013; no passwords or logins to remember. This builds on yesterday&#x2019;s news that PayPal will be available on the new&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/mobile/mobile-world-congress-paypal-app-allows-samsung-gear-2-owners-to-shop-and-pay/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Samsung Gear 2 smartwatches</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Samsung is one of the world&apos;s most trusted handset makers, with a presence in more than 150 countries. By using fingerprint authentication instead of a traditional login and password on the new Samsung Galaxy S5, consumers benefit from an even more secure and seamless mobile and in-store shopping experience across the millions of merchants that accept PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We spearheaded the&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://fidoalliance.org/news/launch.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance</a>&#xA0;last year and predicted that the industry would soon&#xA0;<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21577594\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">move beyond passwords</a>, and this announcement brings us one step closer to that reality. By working with Samsung to leverage fingerprint authentication technology on their new Samsung Galaxy S5, we are able to demonstrate to consumers don&#x2019;t need to sacrifice convenience to increase security. With a simple swipe of a finger, consumers can still securely log into their PayPal account to shop and pay with the convenience that mobile devices afford.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Security has always been and continues to be of utmost importance to PayPal. A crucial part of this commitment is leveraging technology that improves security without adding complexity and confusion.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal provides a secure wallet in the cloud and doesn&#x2019;t store personal information on the device. Customers can use their finger to pay with PayPal from their new Samsung Galaxy S5 because the FIDO Ready&#x2122; software on the device securely communicates between the fingerprint sensor on their device and PayPal&#x2019;s service in the cloud. The only information the device shares with PayPal is a unique encrypted key that allows PayPal to verify the identity of the customer without having to store any biometric information on PayPal&#x2019;s servers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Starting in April, PayPal fingerprint authentication on the Samsung Galaxy S5 will be available in 26 markets, including Australia, Brazil, Hong Kong, Russia, United Kingdom and United States.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Stay on top of PayPal&#x2019;s news at Mobile World Congress by us following us&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3357\" style=\"\" title=\"\">@PAYPAL</a>.

In partnership with Interbank - an innovative Peruvian financial institution that is equally committed to bringing secure and convenient payments to local businesses and consumers &#x2013; we launched a service that gives merchants the opportunity to withdraw funds from their PayPal account into their local Interbank savings account in dollars or Peruvian soles.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For years, Peruvian consumers and merchants have been able to use PayPal when making online purchases or to sell abroad. So, why does this new alliance matter? First, this partnership makes it easier for Peruvian merchants to open a PayPal account and gain access to PayPal&#x2019;s 143+ million global customers. Second, by being able to easily access the funds in their PayPal accounts, the service gives merchants more liquidity and flexibility.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This alliance will positively affect companies like&#xA0;<a title=\"Alpaca Expeditions\" href=\"http://www.alpacaexpeditions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Alpaca Expeditions</a>, an adventure tour company in Peru whose growth relies on both local and international business. Since implementing PayPal in June of 2012, Alpaca Expeditions has grown their online sales with PayPal to over $500,000 per year. In fact, PayPal transactions now make up 95% of their online business.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Global eCommerce represents a&#xA0;<a title=\"$105 billion dollar opportunity\" href=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-unveils-modern-spice-routes-cross-border-shopping-creates-economic-opportunity-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">$105 billion dollar opportunity</a>, and Alpaca Expeditions is a testament to the fact that safe, secure payment options are integral to allowing merchants to tap into the global online marketplace. Selling to a broader consumer base and harnessing the growth of global ecommerce gives merchants a marked advantage, a fact that is supported by our own internal data and external research.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Currently 25% of PayPal&#x2019;s business is cross border, meaning the buyer and seller are in different countries. And, our recent Latin American study on&#xA0;<a title=\"&#x201C;La Nueva Ruta de las Especias&#x201D;\" href=\"http://lanuevarutadelasespecias.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">&#x201C;La Nueva Ruta de las Especias&#x201D;</a>&#xA0;(Translation: &#x201C;The New Spice Routes&#x201D;) shows that merchants who conduct at least 25% of their online business abroad grew at an average rate of 70% between 2011 and 2012. Cross border commerce is an opportunity that PayPal wants merchants to fully take advantage of, by easily selling to other countries within Latin America, to North American neighbors or to buyers across the world in Asia or Europe.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Innovative partnerships with local banks will help us get there. The model that we&#x2019;ve put in place with Interbank and with other financial institutions in the region can be replicated across Latin America and the world. We look forward to continuing our journey with Interbank and helping more companies like Alpaca Expeditions connect with the millions of global consumers who buy with PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

PayPal is helping to fill a distinct need for capital in the small business community: already, customers have collectively borrowed and repaid tens of millions of dollars. Reflecting overwhelming customer satisfaction, a number of businesses repaid their initial loans in full, and subsequently re-applied for new loans. Due to the success of the three-month pilot program, we recently announced plans to extend the PayPal Working Capital product indefinitely. This includes eligibility extended to more U.S. businesses, and with plans to launch a similar offering in additional countries.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Applying for PayPal Working Capital, which is issued by the lender WebBank, takes just minutes because it is based on each business&#x2019;s sales history through PayPal. Ease and convenience are monumental reasons why merchant response has exceeded our expectations. We have received strong feedback from PayPal Working Capital business customers of all types in a recent customer satisfaction survey. In fact, 90 percent of our customers gave us a 9 or 10 (on scale of 0-10) on their likelihood to recommend PayPal Working Capital to other merchants. Merchants are overwhelmingly pleased with how PayPal Working Capital allows them to repay their loan balance using a share of their sales, with no fixed payment dates to remember and no monthly minimums. They enjoy the peace of mind that the flexible repayment structure allows. Other highlights of our survey*:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">We know that a small business&#x2019;s time is precious and are pleased that 97 percent of those surveyed gave us the top rating of &quot;very fast&quot; on speed of application and funding.</li><li style=\"\">92 percent gave us the top 2 ratings for our customer service &#x2013; a strong PayPal differentiator.</li></ul>More than half of borrowers reported using the loan to purchase inventory, including&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/workingcapital/success\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Steve Contratto</a>, owner of CF Sales, a company that sells Logitech computer accessories. Steve leveraged his $20,000 PayPal Working Capital loan to purchase inventory, which he turned into $40,000 in sales, growing his business by 40 percent for that month**.&#xA0; The program is making a real difference in the lives of small business owners by helping them grow. We look forward to sharing more details of our product expansion soon.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\">*PayPal Working Capital Customer Satisfaction Survey, conducted by PayPal, February 27, 2014.</em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\">** Not every business will be able to achieve this type of growth from the PayPal Working Capital loan.</em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

This wasn&#x2019;t a promise we were making to a few. Our mission was to change the way the world thought about and used money. Over the years, hundreds of millions of people have come to share in that promise. This week we reached a major milestone on our global journey. Starting from today we will be rolling out PayPal to ten new markets, taking the total number of markets we serve to 203.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Over 200 markets now enjoy a safer and easier way to pay online.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">For the people of Belarus, Cameroon, C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire, Macedonia, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Nigeria, Paraguay, and Zimbabwe, this will not be the first time they have had access to global commerce. As technology continues to break down barriers, the world is getting smaller. We can buy the things we want from almost anywhere in the world and many people in these ten markets rely on overseas websites to get access to the goods and services they can&#x2019;t find at home.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The problem is that people are understandably wary of providing credit or debit card information to a storeowner they don&#x2019;t know who operates in a distant country. For the sellers too, accepting credit or debit card payments from buyers in a market they know little about can feel like a risk.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Now, by registering for a PayPal account, the people in these ten markets can shop online at millions of websites with the peace of mind that comes from knowing we don&#x2019;t share their financial information with any merchant.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And, if something does go wrong &#x2013; a product doesn&#x2019;t arrive or doesn&#x2019;t match the seller&#x2019;s description, for example &#x2013; they have the added assurance that they may be reimbursed the cost of the purchase and the postage on eligible items, thanks to PayPal Buyer Protection.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Of course, this is all great news for businesses as well. Ten new markets means more opportunities for businesses to sell their goods and services backed by the reassurance of one of the world&#x2019;s most trusted ways to make and receive payments.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Why these markets and why now, you might ask? It takes a lot of careful planning and preparation to enter a new market, and we take our responsibility to manage people&#x2019;s money very seriously. We believe we can seamlessly integrate these markets into our platform and provide the investment and resources needed in things like customer service. More importantly, we believe there is demand. Demand for a safer way to pay and take part in the global commerce revolution.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We&#x2019;re delighted that we can be there to help and to continue to deliver on our promise.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">April 28, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Contributing Writer</strong><br><br><span style=\"\">Imagine a day of shopping. You walk into your favorite store and a sales associate greets you by name. Your size and style are in the store&#x2019;s system, so a dressing room is prepped with options based on your previous purchases and browsing history. Next you spot some shoes you like but they&#x2019;re not in your size. A salesperson whips out a tablet, orders a pair from the location a few cities over, and schedules them to be delivered to your home that afternoon.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">When it&#x2019;s time to pay you realize you left your wallet in the car, but no matter. Your smartwatch &#x2013; the same one that trained you on your run that same morning &#x2013; takes care of the bill.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">While this scenario may seem a bit far-fetched, it isn&#x2019;t some sci-fi episode. This is the future of shopping: convenient, enjoyable and, most notably, extra personal.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">In fact, the personal touch has always been top of mind. It used to rule retail, defining a time when shopkeepers held tabs for town residents and kept track of their growing families and changing needs. And &#x2013; perhaps ironically - it&#x2019;s the proliferation of new technology that will bring us back to that targeted experience in a more seamless way than ever before.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">No Lines, No Worries</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Already, retailers big and small are testing or deploying virtual fitting rooms, 3-D scanners, wallet-free payments systems (like PayPal&#x2019;s!) and tags that provide reams of product information and technology to pitch you on the best deals. Meanwhile, sales associates armed with handheld checkout devices roam the sales floor looking to help you buy where it&#x2019;s most convenient.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#x201C;That long line of cash registers in the store is going to fade away,&#x201D; says Nikki Baird, analyst with Retail Systems Research. &#x201C;Nobody wants to stand in line.&#x201D;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And nobody will have to. Gartner retail analyst Jeffrey Roster claims the retail industry will experience more innovation in the next three years than at any other time in its history. &#x201C;Stores need to be [a retailer&#x2019;s] best asset. Not a liability.&#x201D;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Your Preferences are in Control</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One of the biggest opportunities for retail in the coming years will be the ability to recognize shoppers as they arrive. And instead of requiring a shop keep with an excellent memory, various technologies will enable the automatic authentication of visitors, opening up a whole new world of targeted experiences. Imagine receiving personalized offers based on previous purchases, or even your exact location in the store. If you&#x2019;re lingering in the kitchenware section, for example, you might receive an alert for a coupon for a set of dishes.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Further, Brian Kilcourse of Retail Systems Research expects store shelves, whether in the supermarket or the shirt department, to include digital information overlays &#x2013; made accessible through an app &#x2013; so shoppers can get even more information that&#x2019;s relevant and interesting.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">A high-end boutique, for instance, may show information on how fabrics and clothes are made. Meanwhile, while buying salmon to cook for dinner, you might get a new recipe and wine tips.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The technology &#x201C;plays up the information factor but also makes shopping fun,&#x201D; Kilcourse says.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">The Possibilities are Endless</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">A search for what will likely be the norm down the line turns up Seattle-based retailer, Hointer.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The retailer enables customers to scan tags on each item. The tags link to video clips or product highlights. When a customer is ready to try something on, they use the Hointer app on their phones and are directed to certain dressing rooms.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Within 30 seconds, the items appear in the dressing room via an automated system. Customers can order different sizes &#x2014;or get help from a store associate&#x2014;via a digital screen. Want to dump an item? Send it down a dressing room chute. No clutter.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">A Better World for You, Me and We</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And speaking of no clutter? Baird also expects more &#x201C;showroom&#x201D; stores. Instead of browsing racks of clothing, you&#x2019;ll browse via touch screen. After picking items to try on, you&#x2019;ll order them in the desired colors and have them shipped home. You&#x2019;ll get a custom experience, and by stocking fewer items, retailers cut down on inventory costs.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Baird also sees more retailers devoting more floor space to services or events targeting their particular audience. Pet supply retailers, for instance, are already using ample retail space for grooming services or vaccination clinics. Meanwhile, outdoor gear retailer REI has event space where shoppers can listen to guest speakers.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">In other words, the four walls of the store aren&#x2019;t going to go away, they&#x2019;re just going to look exactly like you want them to.</span><br><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

I was lucky enough to take part in a roundtable discussion put on by MSLGROUP and PRWeek that hit on a topic near and dear to many - millennials. Titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.prweek.com/article/1297993/millennials-expect-brands-help-change-world\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Brand Purpose, Millennials and the Epic Creative that Engages Them</a>,&#x201D; the wide ranging conversation (it&apos;s amazing how much you can fit into two hours) hit on the many facets of why millennials are a force to be reckoned with.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>One area that I am personally passionate about is the importance of brands to not only listen to, but engage with the people who use their products and services day in and day out. Times are changing - money is becoming mobile. Entire industries that didn&apos;t exist just a few years ago have capitalized on this, allowing for a variety of services from the swipe of your finger - personal drivers, on-demand food, you name it. Millennials (and the 21% of consumer spending they represent in the US) have embraced this change with more fervor than any other age group.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It&apos;s one thing to know who your customer is, it&apos;s another to engage with them effectively. In the case of PayPal specifically, we knew we had to do a better job of engaging with millennials. How did we do it? We went to the source. We sat back and listened - then made changes not based on what we thought would work, but what our actual users told us they needed. It wasn&apos;t just our users - this was an open conversation with our employees too. The average age of our web design team at PayPal is 26. They did an amazing job reworking&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.paypal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PayPal.com</a>&#xA0;in the past year, bringing a fresh and more engaging feel to the site. This past April, we redesigned our logo and launched a new brand identity all aligned with bringing the people behind our brand to the front, along with the people who use our products every day.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This is an ongoing conversation much bigger than one roundtable or one conference, but keep an eye on PayPal as we continue to evolve in this space. I look forward to hearing from you about where you see the biggest opportunities (and challenges) as we all learn together.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

No, Tom Ford did not design my pair. Yes, I may have looked like I walked off of the set of&#xA0;<em style=\"\">Robocop</em>, but I wore them with such pride because it allowed me to bring the magic of New York Fashion Week to scores of people who have never experienced what it is like. I tweeted videos from the front rows of shows and I did interviews telling everyone about my experience with Glass because it truly did make the fashion week experience so much more fun for me.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">With that, my cover was blown. You see, when it comes right down to it, I&#x2019;m just as big a tech nerd as I am a fashion nerd.&#xA0; Always have been, always will be. I was first in line to get a Palm Pilot (remember Palm Pilots?).&#xA0;I was one of the first promoters of BlackBerry&#x2014;I was even part of their campaign. Now, I have to have every tablet that comes out, and test almost every new phone.&#xA0;I am constantly on the look out for the next new gadget, but I&#x2019;ll admit, until very recently, technology and fashion have not been on speaking terms. All that seems to be changing. &#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">In the past year, several big fashion/tech partnerships have blossomed. To name a few: Apple announced that they hired YSL&#x2019;s Paul DeNeuve and Burberry&#x2019;s Angela Ahrendts; Tory Burch paired with FitBit to deliver a more stylish version of the immensely popular personal fitness tracker; and Google Glass joined forces with Luxottica (the company that owns fashionable sunglass brands such as Ray Ban and Oliver Peoples) to develop a new line of Glasses that won&#x2019;t stick out so much in the tents next year at fashion week.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">It&#x2019;s official. Fashion and technology are getting serious about their relationship. And there is love there.&#xA0;So much love, in fact, that analysts at Credit Suisse estimate that wearable technology will grow to a $50 billion industry over the next 3-5 years. What excites me most is that this kind of revenue will not only be generated by big names in fashion,&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">but entrepreneurs with good ideas and the guts to pursue them.</strong>&#xA0;Like the Everpurse, a line of handbags that charge your phone. The company was founded by Liz Salcedo, who raised funds on Kickstarter. &#xA0;Or the MEMI, an iPhone compatible bracelet that vibrates when you have a call.&#xA0; You can also set it so it only vibrates when important calls come through and you don&#x2019;t have to be a slave to your phone 24/7.&#xA0; It was created by two moms, not surprisingly.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Every morning, I am hoping for the next big partnership announcement from companies like&#xA0;Samsung, Apple, Instagram, and Microsoft.&#xA0;Technology is becoming more and more interwoven into the fabric of our lives; it is only a matter of time before clothing will adjust to the temperature of our bodies and we will be able to record moments with the bat of an eyelash.&#xA0;And, as the market becomes&#xA0;over-saturated&#xA0;with product, the need for designers and curators will become ever&#xA0;more apparent.&#xA0;I think we will see that content will take center stage, not just the gadgets themselves.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">A door has just started to open, my smart designer and techie friends.

Just five or six &#x201C;testers&#x201D; can help uncover your biggest problem areas.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">2. Streamline your checkout process</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The more steps in your checkout process, the higher the likelihood for cart abandonment.&#xA0;It may sound harsh, but think of it like this: The more form fields (and screens) customers face, the more likely they are to abandon a purchase. To streamline your checkout, focus on removing roadblocks on the path from selection to completed purchase.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">3. Keep your eyes on the prize &#x2013; the sale</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It can be tempting to use the checkout process to gather as much information as possible. But &#x201C;can&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t always equal &#x201C;should.&#x201D; Only ask for information required to complete the sale. Remember that a quick, successful checkout nets you that most valuable result: a happy customer who is more likely to return for future purchases.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">4. Think mobile</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Nearly 75% of mobile shoppers will abandon sites that aren&#x2019;t mobile optimized,<span style=\"\">1</span>&#xA0;so make sure your site is mobile-friendly:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Accommodate small screens. Ideally, your site&#x2019;s design should adapt to the device it&#x2019;s viewed on, working on smaller screens as well as it does on larger ones.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Use larger fonts (14 pt. or higher) and bigger buttons. Place call-to-action buttons (like Add to Cart or Check Out) at the top and bottom of each page.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Test. There are services that show you what your site looks like across multiple operating platforms and devices. Choose ones you think are most important and make sure your website is optimized on them.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Use PayPal to streamline the checkout. PayPal account holders can check out using only a mobile phone number and 4-digit PIN. The experience is optimized for mobile devices&#x2014;with fewer clicks and less typing.</span>&#xA0;</li></ul><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">5.&#xA0;Keep customers informed</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Giving customers the right information at the right time can minimize confusion and set expectations.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Eliminate surprises. When a shopper adds a product to the shopping cart, display the description, price, shipping cost, and tax.&#xA0;</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Provide a map. A flow diagram or numbered steps (e.g., &#x201C;3 of 4&#x201D;) can help situate customers, reducing anxiety and frustration.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Brand the checkout. Add your logo to the PayPal checkout page. It boosts confidence that customers are on the right path and can translate into a conversion lift.</span></li></ul><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">6.&#xA0;Put PayPal to work for your business</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Showing shoppers you offer PayPal can have a powerful effect. Customers who use PayPal tend to follow through: PayPal transactions have 70% higher checkout conversion than do non-PayPal transactions.<span style=\"\">4</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Take advantage of the strongly positive association shoppers have with PayPal. Add the PayPal acceptance mark on your home page, ideally &#x201C;above the fold&#x201D; &#x2013; so the viewer doesn&#x2019;t have to scroll down to see it; Product pages, since many customers land on product or category pages via search engines, bypassing your home page;&#xA0;On the checkout page of your shopping cart to reinforce the PayPal association at the time of purchase.&#xA0;</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Promote&#xA0;</span><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/promotional-financing\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Bill Me Later</a><span style=\"\">&#xAE;. Let customers know they have access to financing</span><span style=\"\">3</span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;by placing Bill Me Later banner ads on pages where customers make purchase decisions.

The&#xA0;</span><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/express-checkout\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Check Out with PayPal</a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;button gives customers a shortcut, making cart abandonment less likely.

You don&#x2019;t need to join an expensive gym to get fit, or take a culinary class to sharpen your cooking skills.

Even though I&#x2019;m a proud millennial and &#x201C;digital native,&#x201D; I even surprised myself with my initial hesitancy to welcome this new age of democratized health and fitness. My business is built on the client&#x2019;s need for a capable, expert teacher &#x2013; if everyone has access to a personal trainer in their pocket, why would they need my services?</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">I&#x2019;m happy to admit, oh, how wrong I was! Embracing this notion of &#x201C;fitness for the people&#x201D; has only created positive changes in my business.

In some ways, these apps keep us more connected than ever before, but they can never replace person-to-person interaction &#x2013; and after all, the best motivation comes from other people. This is where we really thrive and push ourselves the hardest.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One startup that has done an incredible job bringing together local, fitness-focused people together is the&#xA0;</span><a href=\"https://www.fitmob.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Fitmob</span></strong></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;app, which connects its users to fitness professionals offering gym-independent group workouts in their own neighborhood that are fun, affordable and effective.

But we already benefit from the start of this shift.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Take Thai food for example.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">You ask your phone, and it gives you a list of options.&#xA0;</span>But why doesn&#x2019;t it filter out obviously bad ones? Or determine that it only need show the closest location of the restaurant chain, and that if two places have a nearly identical menu, but one is 20% more expensive and a mile further away,&#xA0;it shouldn&apos;t come up in your immediate results?<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">This is the future of tech.&#xA0;</span>As humans, we want choices,<em style=\"\">&#xA0;but we don&#x2019;t want 100 choices.</em><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Making the AI Vision a Reality</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Movies like&#xA0;<em style=\"\">Her</em>&#xA0;and Rosie from&#xA0;<em style=\"\">The Jetsons</em>&#xA0;help paint a picture.

The computer becomes your IT person, rather than you working for it. It flips the need to hire tech savvy young employees in place of those with more field expertise. This isn&#x2019;t just a win for those who struggle to keep up with changes in software, but to everyone, because the focus and resources shift from teaching software, to teaching customer service, domain expertise, and sales techniques that ultimately positively impact people at every stage of interaction with the company.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Death to the TPS Report</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The drudge work of&#xA0;<em style=\"\">Office Space</em>&#xA0;and creating &#x201C;TPS Reports&#x201D; will no longer require people. Software will compile data and author reports for people to then add color, commentary and analysis. But all the heavy lifting will be done by software.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">As &#x201C;things&#x201D; start to communicate, it means more sensors, more data and a shift of programming to a series of simple &#x201C;if&#x201D; and &#x201C;when&#x201D; statements:&#xA0;</span><em style=\"\">If</em>&#xA0;it starts to rain, close the windows&#xA0;<em style=\"\">if</em>&#xA0;they are open.&#xA0;<em style=\"\">When</em>&#xA0;it stops raining, open them&#xA0;<em style=\"\">if</em>&#xA0;the outside temperature is between 68 and 75.&#x201D;<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Schools will teach kids logic and coding in 1st grade. Not traditional coding, but procedures entered by voice. After the second grade, rote memorization will be less of a priority, because anything you would want to know is an easy ask away.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Again, this frees up resources and focus -- in this case, for critical thinking. Information retrieval and computer programming will become the new science and social studies curricula.&#xA0;</span>This may sound like something we&#x2019;ve seen on&#xA0;<em style=\"\">Star Trek: the Next Generation</em>, but it&#x2019;s on its way.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And all it means is that tech moves more the background, so we humans can focus on what&#x2019;s unique to us. Our power. Our humanity.&#xA0;</span>I can&#x2019;t wait to see what&#x2019;s&#xA0; unleashed. &#xA0;<br></div>\n\n\t\t",

We&#x2019;ve waited a long time to tell the world the PayPal story, to share our passion for the work we&#x2019;re doing, and to celebrate the people we are doing it for.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When I joined PayPal, I didn&#x2019;t know exactly what I was signing up for. I knew it would be an adventure, and a place where I could take my passion for people (particularly employees) to the next level. Almost four years later, I see clearly our vision to reinvent money coming to life. I look around at my coworkers and I see a shared purpose and vision. Most of all, I look at our customers, and see how our work actually makes people&#x2019;s lives easier.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That&#x2019;s the part of the &#x201C;Powering the People Economy&#x201D; campaign that most people won&#x2019;t see - the story of more than 14,000+ people who come to work every day to create experiences our customers love. To do the right thing. To innovate. To make life easier. And most importantly, to reinvent money for millions of people around the world. They are the heart of PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That&#x2019;s why we knew our employees had to be at the center of the brand campaign launch. &#x201C;Powering the People Economy&#x201D; is their heart and work on display. So we selected a handful of employee ambassadors from around the globe who embody a &#x201C;People Rule&#x201D; spirit , and invited them to New York to star in their own commercials &#x2013; with the same artwork, set, star treatment and other elements that went into the commercials we are currently running as part of our first global brand campaign.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>How do these individuals ensure each day that People Rule?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>By shortening the queue for much-needed morning espresso&#x2026;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>By telling the truth &#x2013; even when it&#x2019;s hard to hear, to make sure the team is working well&#x2026;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>By celebrating teammates&#x2019; humanity, from birthdays to babies&#x2026;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And by making sure people have toast.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Curious?

A real expression of passion for music comes to life at them, and they&#x2019;re growing at an incredible rate. Fans attended twice as many festivals in 2013 compared to the year prior.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And while the chance to see some of your favorite acts in one place over a three day period is amazing, let&#x2019;s be honest: festivals can also be a huge pain in the you-know-what. ATMs are few and far between and often run out of cash. Many vendors only take cash and for those that do take credit cards, they are often sharing one clunky POS system between many sales people, causing a backlog when customers start to pay with cards. And don&#x2019;t even get me started about your festival buddies who conveniently don&#x2019;t have cash to pay you back after you have just bought them&#xA0;<em style=\"\">another</em>&#xA0;round of festival beers.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">With that in mind, PayPal is going to be at some of the biggest music festivals in the US this summer to help attendees deal with the pain points of the existing ways to pay when all you want to do is hear great music.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">First up: Governors Ball in NYC this weekend.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">PayPal + Governors Ball</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">At&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://governorsballmusicfestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Governors Ball</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;this year, (June 6-8 at Randall&#x2019;s Island), PayPal will give New Yorkers a simple and carefree experience that will allow them to pay how and when they want. At the heart of the festival, 13 of the best food vendors (full list below) will be accepting PayPal via the PayPal App. Even better? Users will be able to automatically redeem a $5 offer at each and every one of the vendors by simply &#x201C;checking-in&#x201D; to pay, without ever having to take out their wallets.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">So, what does this mean?

It also means you won&#x2019;t have to worry about having enough cash, finding an ATM, carrying a big wallet or potentially losing your credit card.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Why worry about how to pay for your favorite eats if you don&#x2019;t have to?&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Music Festival Aficionados</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The weekend following Governors Ball, you&#x2019;ll be able to find as Bonnaroo in Tennessee, and we&#x2019;ll also be at Outside Lands in San Francisco&#x2019;s Golden Gate Park in August. At each of these events we&#x2019;ll be helping solve the most common pain points for festival-goers &#x2013; from worrying that your wallet will give you a visible wallet bulge in your carefully curated festival outfit, to whether you have enough cash with you to get you through all 3 days. For vendors, it means having the mobile technology needed to help drive more sales by moving lines faster.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Make sure to check back into see what we&#x2019;ll be up to at Bonnaroo!

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">June 06, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Peter Harrison, CEO, Snagajob</strong><br><br><span style=\"\">My first taste of work was pounding pavement &#x2013; literally &#x2013; as a street sweeper in London. It taught me skills I still use each day as a CEO, and an understanding of what it means to work for an hourly wage is part of why I&#x2019;m so passionate about making life simple and seamless for the seventy-five percent of American workers who fall into that category.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">These are the men and women working in retail, food service, hospitality, security, childcare and dozens of other industries that help drive our country. These are the people who are at the frontline of all our days.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Accordingly, many of the moments that can make or break a mood are delivered by the millions of people in the hourly workforce: from smiles at the coffee shop to friendly cashiers when we&#x2019;re buying groceries with cranky kids in tow. The impact on productivity and human interaction can be enormous, but this group is too often forgotten in our conversations about innovation and the economy.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">As a result, until very recently (and indeed still in many cases) this incredibly important foundation has also been left out of many of the advancements we&#x2019;ve witnessed in cloud and mobile services for job-hunts. LinkedIn, Jobvite and other solutions aimed to ease the process are often focused on salaried workers, and the convenience and mobility they deliver leave the hourly workforce out in the cold.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">At&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.snagajob.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Snagajob</a>, as a network focusing solely on hourly employment, we are mission-focused on making finding a good match much easier for both job seekers and the huge brands that rely on them. We&#x2019;re particularly interested in how mobile lets us reach younger generations, busy moms and other key groups in a way that suits their lifestyles.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Mobile: the First Screen</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And these are groups for which much of the benefit of the Internet was limited by the cost of personal computers and in-home networks. Today, rather than being the &#x2018;second screen&#x2019; that many tech industry people consider the smartphone to be, mobile is actually the first access point for huge numbers of people &#x2013; in the US and beyond. It opens a new world of possibility, in job hunting, in education, and dozens of other life changing areas.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">For example, rather than walking to the local mall or cruising around downtown with their resumes, a survey we conducted found that 72 percent of 16-30 year old Americans search for jobs on their phones.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We used to hear from our job seekers on a regular basis comments like, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have a computer and rely on the library to search for jobs. I only have 30 minutes to search and apply. Help!&#x201D; That conversation has shifted today to, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have a computer and rely on my phone to search for jobs, but some sites aren&#x2019;t mobile friendly.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">The Personal Mobile Connection&#xA0;</span></strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The flexibility of mobility benefits everyone, unlocking the power of the people to connect directly and maintain the human touch that the PC couldn&#x2019;t do. It puts more power in the hands of the people &#x2013; both hiring for and seeking jobs.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">For our customers, that personal connection is key because again, the hourly workers are the frontline of their businesses and have the magic to make or break relationships. Mobile &#x2013; because of its intimate, always-on connectivity &#x2013; delivers the power of big data and other Internet tools while maintaining the person-to-person touch that makes our world move.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Our experience in the job market is huge for us and for both our corporate and consumer customers. But more importantly, it&#x2019;s a great example of the HUGE impact that this people-to-people connection can have to put the world in greater balance. It literally puts incredible power in the hands of more and more people around the world every day.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

PayPal provided a frictionless, fast and efficient payment system that allowed us to work with the best people possible, no matter where they were, and helped us think as a &#x201C;micro multinational&#x201D; from the very beginning, collaborating across borders.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Today at&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.betazeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Betazeta</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;we have writers, designers, developers, and sales teams based in many different countries who are able to keep in touch, collaborate and be paid almost instantly. Just a few years ago, it would have seemed impossible to coordinate. Now? It&#x2019;s seamless and simple.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Global and Local is the Only Way to Go</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Publishing in this new people-driven economy means we have to&#xA0;<em style=\"\">really&#xA0;</em>reflect what the people want, which requires taking the pulse of their tastes and reactions, and doing so at global scale.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One of the keys to our success is a new editorial process where we mix an editor&#x2019;s intuition with the power of big data to understand what people want to read about &#x2013; and&#xA0;<em style=\"\">are&#xA0;</em>reading about &#x2013; to focus our efforts on covering what really matters.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The depth of data and analytics we bring to bear actually makes the human decision and input much more powerful.&#xA0; Now, a single person, embedded in one country/culture, can make informed decisions about a truly global audience, because they&#x2019;re based on patterns and facts that drill down to each locality and also show worldwide trends.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Then we optimize it for various social networks and ensure responsiveness to varied mobile experiences, which is especially important in the developing world, like Latin America, where people are skipping PCs and going straight to a smartphones.&#xA0; Smaller displays, touch-based input, and even the bandwidth requirements are considered to ensure efficiency even on spotty wireless connections in more remote regions.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Finally, we&#x2019;ve opened our communities so that all our members can contribute content, creating a more engaging and diversified experience. This is their conversation. We&#x2019;re honored to facilitate it.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">To think how far we&#x2019;ve come in such a short time is amazing; and I&#x2019;m absolutely awestruck by the community of voices we&#x2019;ve created that can be at once personal and global. We&#x2019;ve been able to put the power of the people to work so successfully in publishing, which is often thought of as archaic and locally driven, it&#x2019;s exciting to imagine what this borderless, connected world can bring to the future of other industries. &#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

But the times have changed. People aren&#x2019;t simply consuming, but are empowered as active individuals to get what they need from each other, rather than buying from corporate channels. This means that established brands are going to have to revise their business models to partner with this empowered crowd, and to really partner&#xA0;<em style=\"\">with</em>, vs. simply trying to sell&#xA0;<em style=\"\">at</em>&#xA0;the people who now rule.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Welcome to the People Economy</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">This is the People Economy. The Collaborative Economy. I recently co-authored&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2014/03/03/report-sharing-is-the-new-buying-winning-in-the-collaborative-economy/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Sharing is the New Buying</a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;with&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.visioncritical.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Vision Critical</a>&#xA0;on the topic, and what we found was both confirming and surprising.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">While used-good sharing marketplaces are well established, Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, Lending Club and other tech platforms that allow peer-to-peer sharing (of accommodations, transportation and crowd-funding), are still in single-digit adoption. BUT, people surveyed indicated that they intend to&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">double</strong>&#xA0;their utilization of these sharing services within the next year. 100% growth in a year! Imagine what it would take for a traditional corporation:seller relationship to see that kind of growth!</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">This is truly the people&#x2019;s movement. Sharing pre-owned goods crosses demographic lines, even far into rural areas, and while some may think that&#x2019;s recession related, it&#x2019;s not. People making over $100K a year were&#xA0;<em style=\"\">more</em>likely to have used shared personal services to source transportation, homes, food, and more than most other groups.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And sharing goods is just the beginning. The rapid adoption of the&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140407013541-82111-the-white-house-embraces-the-maker-movement?trk=mp-reader-card\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Maker Movement</a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;is a perfect example of this new economy. The 9 percent of people who&#x2019;ve bought custom, hand-made products in the past 12 months, is&#xA0;<em style=\"\">also&#xA0;</em>expected to double in the coming year &#x2013; creating an entirely new economy for both buyers and sellers.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Simply Put: People Rule</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">What does this trend mean? People are using new technologies to access goods and services from each other. Directly. They&#x2019;re acquiring and sharing things, including money, directly. People Rule. They&#x2019;re bypassing traditional corporations. The crowd is becoming functional and self-reliant. People can self-fund, make their own goods, share what they already have and provide specialized services to each other.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The call now is for business as we knew it &#x2013; the incumbents being threatened by this movement &#x2013; to stop thinking of how to sell to consumers and to figure out how to grow&#xA0;<em style=\"\">with</em>&#xA0;the crowd. For example:</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Lincoln Motors partnered with makers from CustomMade to build matching jewelry for high-end cars.</li><li style=\"\">GE tapped a crowd innovation community in Quirky to build next-generation electronics.</li><li style=\"\">Walgreens partnered with TaskRabbit to deliver prescriptions to homes.</li><li style=\"\">Home Depot delivered Christmas trees on demand using idle Uber drivers last December.</li><li style=\"\">Kelly Services formed an alliance with oDesk to provide additional workforce resources on demand.</li></ul>For more examples, there are over&#xA0;<a href=\"http://crowdcompanies.com/blog/graphic-a-timeline-of-corporations-in-the-collaborative-economy/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">80 examples on this visual timeline</a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;of large companies partnering with the crowd.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">People like me, people like you &#x2013; we&#x2019;re all proving we can get what we need and share what we have. It&#x2019;s time to get on board &#x2014; or risk losing the crowd.</span><span style=\"\">Large companies working with the crowd are helping to make a world that works better for us all.

These days, I&#x2019;m jetting around the globe, attending runway shows, red carpet events and designer parties with the likes of Chanel, Michael Kors, Versace and Roberto Cavalli. And if I&#x2019;ve learned one thing along the way, it&#x2019;s this: fashion is all about making a statement &#x2013; statement outfits, statement trends, statement personalities.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">But you&#xA0;<em style=\"\">don&#x2019;t</em>&#xA0;want to make the wrong statement by carrying around an annoying wallet that&#x2019;s totally out of synch with your look. Sure, the advent of the digital wallet may seem to some as the &#x201C;solution without a problem&#x201D; because they don&#x2019;t see why paying with a card or cash is hard, but let me tell you, there are fashion problems to be solved!</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">No matter the season, there&#x2019;s always at least one style you just can&#x2019;t rock with a wallet. Let&#x2019;s be honest: nobody wants to see someone wear skin-tight leather pants with an awkward-looking square popping out of their back pocket.&#xA0;<em style=\"\">SO</em>&#xA0;not chic.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Thankfully, a&#xA0;</span><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/pay-in-stores\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">wallet-free</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;lifestyle isn&#x2019;t too far from reality. I look forward to the day when an entire wallet&#x2019;s content can be compressed into a few finger swipes and taps on our phones.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Until then, however, there are few key looks that are most definitely anti-wallet &#x2013; and frankly, anti-cash &#x2013; whether they&#x2019;re pocketless, defined by clean lines or tight, tight, TIGHT. Loose coins and bills are not slowing down our style!&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">From my fashion week uniform to hippy chic festival wear to the slimmest pair of skinny pants you can shamelessly squeeze in to (admit it), here are my top hottest wallet-free looks.&#xA0;</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Just say NO to the wallet bulge!&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">1.

Festival wear is supposed to be about floral patterns, crop tops and fedoras. It&#x2019;s all about peace, love and being free (from your wallet!).&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">6. Poncho</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Pocketless ponchos have no room for the bulk of a wallet.

Like anyone else, I made a few mistakes &#x2013; from bad interview suits (sorry, no pics) to accepting jobs that were not the right fit for me or the career I was looking to develop. Ultimately, I found the career I wanted: building digital companies and hiring the people who make them so special. I got to do this first at Mashable and now at Rachael Ray&#x2019;s parent company, Watch Entertainment, but it was definitely a process to find what I loved.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Luckily, there are now more ways to connect directly to people than ever before, and for graduates, it&#x2019;s the perfect time to take a quick moment to take stock of your hopes, dreams, talents &#x2013; and online profiles &#x2013; because you hold the reins in a way that&#x2019;s often as terrifying as it is empowering.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Be Honest About What You Want</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I remember realizing that leaving the dorms meant moving back in with my parents, so I wanted a paycheck that could help me rent an apartment sooner than later (love ya, Mom and Dad!). Stressing about this, along with the amount of responsibility you&#x2019;re about to take on, is easy, but it&#x2019;s not worth it. Decisions made out of fear or worry don&#x2019;t often pan out the way we&#x2019;d hope.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Back in the day, job-seekers literally hit the pavement looking to learn about what positions might be available, but now you can move faster through efficient and effective online research. While you&#x2019;re suffering senioritis, browse through the job listings and sites of companies you think match your interests and skills. Do you know people who work there? Beyond the official listings and sites, check LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. to do a little digging to see if their marketing and your perception of the company match what it&#x2019;s like to work there (wait to reach out, though &#x2013; we&#x2019;ll cover that later). Company culture really matters, and this &#x201C;homework&#x201D; can help you be more thoughtful about where you apply.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As a next step, I&#x2019;d recommend visiting&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">The Muse</span></a>, a career site that offers a very visual job board, training and daily stories that can help you as you start your search.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">You Can Find What&apos;s Real, and Hiring Managers Can, Too</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While you might spend hours perfecting your work history and polishing your LinkedIn profile, hiring managers will look online to assess your judgment and learn whether you&#x2019;d be a good fit with the team they&#x2019;re trying to build. It&#x2019;s sad when a candidate with an ideal resume has to be turned away after a Google search takes them out of the running.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>What happens when&#xA0;<em style=\"\">you</em>&#xA0;Google yourself? Would a hiring manager find your Instagram and Tumblr account and like what they see? This can make the difference between getting hired and not. Distinguish yourself with a consistent presence; ditch typos and any potentially inappropriate content and position yourself as impressive and worth considering for the job &#x2013; without stripping out all the personality that might make you perfect for the role you seek.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Feel it out, Firsthand</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Once you&#x2019;ve identified your industry of interest, find organizations, industry groups and meetups where like-minded people gather. For example,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/CMmeetup/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Community Managers Meetup</span></a>&#xA0;gets NYC social media people together to learn, meet each other and find jobs.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">May 05, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Sam Shank,&#xA0;CEO, HotelTonight</strong><br><br>One thing that mobile technology has really enhanced, and in some cases entirely enabled, is a lifestyle that encourages spontaneity. Decide to stay at the office and won&#x2019;t have time to cook?&#xA0;<a href=\"http://eat24.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Eat24</a>&#xA0;can have food at your place by the time you arrive.&#xA0;Or maybe it&apos;s the&#xA0;last day of a trip and you want to stay an extra night.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.kayak.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Kayak</a>&#xA0;can help find a new flight.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One of the last bastions of the &#x201C;old way&#x201D; was figuring out where to crash at the last minute &#x2013; because nothing kills spontaneity like having to spend time on the phone only to find a rate so high it kills the mood, or trying to enter details into a site not optimized for a small screen and thumbs.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">My frustration with that distinct buzzkill is what led to the birth of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.hoteltonight.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">HotelTonight</a>, which has created a unique marketplace that helps hotels and weary travelers find each other in the magic moments when life presents a reason to change plans.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The Basics</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Because it is only recently that people have considered last-minute hotel bookings, most hoteliers would just set and forget a flat rate for the very few last-minute bookings they might receive.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">When we first got started, my co-founder Jared would get emails from hotels with their rates and allotments for each day &#x2013; definitely not as sleek and seamless a back-end process as what we were offering bookers through the app.&#xA0;It was still a guessing game, with hoteliers taking a stab at a rate that might attract last-minute bookers that day, and then us building it into the app to test.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">So we decided to make the process for hotels as simple as it is for our buyers, delivering visibility across the entire market and the ability to make real-time changes to rates as they see what competitors are doing.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We basically help hotels and their potential customers communicate with transparency and clear data. As people get more comfortable booking last-minute, hotels are able to see (through our data) what drives their decisions and make their offering as attractive as possible. It&#x2019;s win-win-win, and it&#x2019;s wild and invigorating to see how quickly it&#x2019;s all taking off.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Less Time Paying, More Time Playing</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One of the coolest outcomes we&#x2019;ve seen? Because we&#x2019;re a mobile-only company, we made an app that helps them manage</span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;inventory on the go. Many have joked that we&#x2019;ve helped turn something as dry as &#x201C;yield management&#x201D; into a game by making it so easy to play with rates as they look to beat competitors by optimizing revenue and occupancy. &#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The result? The average hotel now switches things up at least 4 times a day, while in competitive, high-volume markets like New York City, it&#x2019;s not uncommon to see a hotel change rates 10 times per day, making adjustments late into the night.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Anaheim&#x2019;s race to capture the Disney spirit is a great example of how spontaneity benefits everyone. Experimentation showed that reducing a room rate by 15% at 9pm can capture the business of a family deciding whether or not to make a late night trip to Disneyland, so they&#x2019;re the first in line the next day to enjoy the park.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The kids from these families are growing up in a world that will celebrate this level of last-minute adventure, seeding in them new values and appreciation for what might be waiting just around a corner. It&#x2019;s so exciting to imagine the way that the human spirit will be empowered and rewarded as new tech and tools continue to help us realize our dreams.&#xA0; &#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\"><span style=\"\">How else does technology empower spontaneity?</span></em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter can also make it easy to promote yourself, upload and share your designs, and stay in contact with your fans and customers. Having all of these platforms at our fingertips makes it possible for artists to turn their passions into profit, and sometimes, full-time jobs.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Gilded Shadows</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Turning that passion into a full-time job is exactly what I wanted to do. In the spring of 2011, a friend asked me to help her choose accessories for her upcoming wedding. I had always been interested in design and fashion &#x2013; I love to sew and had dabbled in jewelry design, so I was more than happy to help her. After doing plenty of research online, I took a chance and made a headpiece myself. The experience of making the accessory satisfied my creative itch and she loved what I had developed for her. As a result, I offered to make headpieces for the rest of her bridal party as a gift. After the wedding, my husband and friends kept encouraging me to open an Etsy shop to sell bridal accessories. I&#x2019;m an architect working a full time job in Los Angeles so opening an online business and adding to my already full workload made me a little hesitant. However, their reassuring gestures and that little voice in my head that kept saying &#x201C;what if?&#x201D; just wouldn&#x2019;t go away.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So I listened to them and later that summer, I launched&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/GildedShadows\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Gilded Shadows</a>, an Etsy shop specializing in bridal headpieces, veils, and other accessories. In just three years, I have been able to turn my hobby into a successful online business. I still pinch myself over the fact that a hobby I love so much keeps me so busy with ongoing work!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>On a daily basis, I get to interact with brides from all over the world and design unique handmade items that they get to wear on their special day. I also get to do business with other Etsy store owners who sell me lace, buttons, vintage fabrics, and millinery supplies. &#xA0;I recently received an email from a bride that had photos of her in the veil from the wedding and a note that said, &#x201C;Thank you for the veil. It was the talk of the wedding!&#x201D; I take great pride when the brides can have that kind of experience from something that I created. I feel so honored to have been part of such a memorable day for them. This is why I love what I do.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Full-time Passion</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I have many friends, vendors, customers and other supporters to credit my success to, but it&#x2019;s also quite remarkable how big of a role Etsy and PayPal have played in making it all a reality.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In fact &#x2013; it&#x2019;s all so real that I&#x2019;m actually planning the big next step of turning my architecture day job into a hobby and pursuing my Gilded Shadows business full time. I&#x2019;ll be moving to Austin, Texas with my husband and two rescue dogs to embark on the next chapter of our lives &#x2013; where I&#x2019;m hoping to take Gilded Shadows to new heights &#x2013; always aiming to make a bride-to-be&#x2019;s day a little better, one handmade wedding accessory at a time.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Saving time, the timing of when offers reach shoppers, the time it takes to transact, the velocity of the moment when the thought to shop strikes, the times and ways people use smartphones vs. computers, and the list goes on.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">It was based upon this &#x201C;time = money&#x201D; premise (not exactly a new concept!) that I founded&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.kiip.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Kiip</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;in 2010. We&#x2019;re always working to better understand how to become a part of people&#x2019;s lives at the right moment, and for the right reason, tailoring rewards specific to their preferences and environment. For example,</span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;surprise you with promo for Sephora when you&#x2019;re in a beauty app, or for fitness gear when you&#x2019;re logging your progress in a workout app.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">It&#x2019;s a win-win for shoppers and brands alike, because it&#x2019;s a much more effective (and welcome) way to get their attention rather than just serving up another ad.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">When you really think about it, it&#x2019;s hard to believe how quickly mobile has adapted to our lifestyle and habits. I&#x2019;m particularly excited about a few key trends I&#x2019;m observing that are really accelerating how often and how broadly we use our phones &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s no coincidence that it all has to do with saving us time.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Technology for the Speed of Life</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.hipmunk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Hipmunk</a>&#xA0;does a fantastic job considering how and why people toggle between mobile and desktop when booking travel. They know price discovery and comparison is an easy task to accomplish when taking a bus or watching TV, but when it&#x2019;s time to actually throw down a couple grand for a trip, many people are more willing to do that from their computer. So Hipmunk makes that SUPER easy, delivering a 5-letter code to copy from mobile into the website, so people can pickup where they left off and buy.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Companies like&#xA0;<a href=\"http://postmates.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Postmates</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Uber Rush</strong>&#xA0;are delivering on the promise of instant gratification from same-day (or even same-hour). And a huge number of exclusively mobile commerce sites have emerged &#x2013; like&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Uber</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.lyft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Lyft</a>, etc. &#x2013; that exist specifically (and entirely) for the mobile moments of life.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Why are these companies so successful? They remove friction from the process, and increase productivity, and that&#x2019;s what mobile is all about &#x2013; technology that moves at the speed of life, and not the other way around.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Instantly Moving Money</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The ability to track purchase details by device, vs. by retail account is also a huge timesaver. Having your credit card information and shipping preferences stored by a third party like PayPal makes the mobile experience seamless and quick. It doesn&#x2019;t require clunky, repetitive thumb-entry; it makes conversion from discovery to purchase almost instant; it doesn&#x2019;t follow with a huge number of sales emails like you get from dozens of retail accounts; and your details and identity are protected at the device level, in some cases, with the added level of biometric security.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We&#x2019;ve come so far in 5 years, and I expect more change in the next 5 that will further enhance the simplicity and ease of buying. The death of the physical credit card is inevitable; the magnetic stripe and punched numbers will be a non-entity, because they&#x2019;re only meant to verify identity and we&#x2019;re advancing WAY beyond that in sophistication and unique personal identifiers: Your iris.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Mobile-World-Congress-Forget-Your-Passwords-Samsung-Galaxy-S5/ba-p/782416\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Your fingerprint</a>.

Well, most importantly, you&#x2019;re getting more of your time back. You&#x2019;re wasting less of it on crawling the Internet for airfare deals, waiting for taxis or picking up your dinner takeout. You don&#x2019;t have to spend time to spend money. It has always been true that the most successful businesses are those that put&#xA0;<em style=\"\">people</em>&#xA0;first, and the digital age is empowering and accelerating this in ways we couldn&#x2019;t have predicted just a few years ago.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The potential is undeniable, and the future is now. It&#x2019;s going to be fun &#x2013; just imagine the possibilities.</span><br><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

In fact, earlier this year we were proud to deliver the first payment experience on the Samsung wearable devices&#x2014;with the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/PayPal-on-the-Samsung-Galaxy-S5-Gear-2-and-Gear-Fit-is-Finally/ba-p/798404\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Gear 2 and Gear Fit</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>From a development perspective, this means creating a user experience that is designed specifically for wearables. The tiny device screens alone require developers to rethink the user interface (UI). A truly wearable optimized application has to be a completely fluid, streamlined and contextual experience. However, with new devices from multiple manufactures rapidly coming to market, without using a somewhat device-agnostic development approach, keeping pace presents a challenge.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With Google&#x2019;s introduction of its Android Wear&#x2122; OS, developers are now better positioned to really drive innovation and take full advantage of the potential wearable devices present.

With Android Wear, we&#x2019;re able to add just a few lines of code to leverage stacks, pages and simple notification replies. From there, with the full SDK, we can create totally unique Android Wear experiences.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With the official release of the Android Wear SDK at Google I/O, we are excited to share what we&#x2019;ve been working on. Starting this week, by leveraging the Android Wear OS and new SDK, we&#x2019;ll begin to release the PayPal App on Android Wear to our&#xA0;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/paypal-wear\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Beta Community.</a>&#xA0;And in the coming weeks, the PayPal App will be available on the latest Android Wear devices&#x2014;including the recently announced Motorola Moto360 and LG&#x2019;s G Watch. Once available, the PayPal app will allow Android Wear device owners, to check-in to pay at local stores, redeem offers, and receive payment notifications while on the go (and in some cases with just the command of your voice).<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>As new wearable devices come to market, I personally look forward to seeing where developers are going to take us.

We want to make them simpler, more secure, more enjoyable.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>But to assume we, sitting in San Jose, know what that means everywhere in the world ignores the incredibly rich diversity across the 203 markets we serve around the globe. Even with our on the ground teams in these markets, deep customer driven insights and other ways we keep tabs on existing and future customers, we don&#x2019;t know enough.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So we decided that to really empower the people in the rapidly changing, global marketplace we serve, we should go out and ask a broad sample directly about how they feel about various topics related to money, time, technology and other elements of the People Powered Economy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The results are in, and we&#x2019;re excited to share.</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The main takeaway is that we seem to be on the right track: the vast majority of the world agrees that technology should make things&#xA0;<span style=\"\">simpler, connected and faster, delivering more choices and opportunities.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The obstacles in the way, how to spend found time, and daily grievances vary significantly among countries, but it seems the world is ready for the People Economy we&#x2019;re working so hard each day to power. For cash to disappear and mobile payments to get easier. For online transactions to simply and safely open access to the rest of the world&#x2019;s goods. For an easier way to experience life&#x2019;s moments and to express spontaneous generosity.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Knowing that what we deliver helps improve the quality of people&#x2019;s lives helps keep us true to the mission that has driven PayPal from the very beginning, as delivered by cofounder Peter Thiel:&#xA0;</span>to &#x201C;give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had&#xA0;before.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ve come so far already, and can&#x2019;t wait to reveal what the future holds.&#xA0;<span style=\"\">What do you hope to see?</span><br><em style=\"\">For more stories on how both PayPal and individuals just like yourself are powering the People Economy, visit&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.peoplerule.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">peoplerule.com</a></em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

The secret to her sweet success is liquid nitrogen, which freezes ice cream at extremely low temperatures resulting in smaller ice crystals and extra creaminess. Our lucky marketing team at PayPal got a close-up look at the making of this dense and tasty treat, which uses an innovative machine that Robyn creatively patented&#xA0;<em style=\"\">Brrr</em><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#x2122;.&#xA0;</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Even better?

Ice cream made to order! How cool is that?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When asked what the best thing about owning her own business was, Robyn undoubtedly said, &#x201C;the people,&#x201D; and highlighted inspiring happiness with something as simple as ice cream (including seasonal flavors like Fresh Mint Chip and Nectarine). She also noted giving customers more ways to pay also makes them even happier, as the PayPal Check-in process prevents the need to fumble for a wallet. &#x201C;Customers can find us on the PayPal app then all they have to do is check-in, order and use their phones to pay. It&#x2019;s as easy as that.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With their previous POS system, Robyn and team used to have to write orders on Post-It notes, which would often fall and result in frustrated customers.

These are not online locations. These are cafes, cinemas, restaurants and parking meters. From today, it becomes possible to order and pay for food or drinks ahead of arriving at a cafe; to pay at the table in a restaurant without calling over the waiter, or pay for parking without searching for the closest meter. All that&apos;s needed is the PayPal smartphone application linked to a PayPal account.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">By clicking on the local tab, app users&#xA0;will be able to see participating local businesses nearby, swipe to check-in to the one they want, and pay directly with PayPal. It&#x2019;s all part of PayPal&#x2019;s mission to make life easier and give people more control over their money.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">This development was made possible thanks to a partnership with&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">MyOrder</strong>, the mobile order and payment system backed by Rabobank in the Netherlands. MyOrder has done a fantastic job building a nationwide community of businesses, any of which can now accept offline PayPal payments with no additional investment.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">It is one of many such partnerships that PayPal is signing to bring mobile payments to life:</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">In Germany, we announced a trial with&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">payleven</strong>&#xA0;that will introduce cashless payments nationwide, while our partnership with&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">orderbird</strong>&#xA0;is expanding PayPal Check-In beyond Berlin to 70 towns and cities around the country.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">In France and Austria,&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">McDonald&apos;s</strong>&#xA0;customers can order ahead and pay with PayPal before picking up their food at a restaurant of their choice.&#xA0;</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Visitors to&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Westfield London</strong>, one of largest shopping and leisure destinations in the UK, can pay for parking from their PayPal app without having to fumble for change.&#xA0;</span></li></ul><span style=\"\">Payments are changing. Last year, of the $180 billion of payments processed by PayPal, $27 billion were made from a smartphone or tablet. That was up 99% on the previous year. Mobile payments are happening now and businesses are adapting, whether that&#x2019;s&#xA0;by integrating their locations into the PayPal app, or adding PayPal as an easier way to check out in their own mobile app.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The value that PayPal brings is the trust we have established with 152 million account holders across 203 markets around the world. That trust is built on 15 years of managing electronic payments, the reassurance that we never share financial information with anyone and the confidence that PayPal Buyer Protection can help recover funds if something goes wrong.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">That trust puts us in a unique position to lead mobile payments on a global scale. Whether it&#x2019;s helping people pay from their table in the Netherlands or authorizing a payment with a fingerprint in Italy, PayPal will continue to work with other forward-thinking companies to change the way we shop and pay in Europe and around the world.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

As I sit in the Recife airport and wait for the inevitable call to board my plane home, I can&#x2019;t help but feel overwhelmed by gratitude. The people, the community, the laughter, the passion, the tears and most of all, the love. I knew coming into this experience I would learn a few things but I could have never imagined the level of life lessons I would take back with me. I&#x2019;d like to share four of the most important with you.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Be thankful for what you have.&#xA0;</strong></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span></strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Working on houses with broken roofs, cracked walls, cockroaches, dirt floors and dirty water has made me realize how much I have to be thankful for. The community of Bomba do Hemet&#xE9;rio doesn&#x2019;t have the luxury of some of the simplest things we taken for granted every day of our lives. &#xA0;My heart broke when I found out that Patricia (the woman whose house I worked on) is pregnant. She doesn&#x2019;t have a roof that will withstand rainfall yet she has no choice but to bring her small bundle of joy into the only house she can give her. Yes we built her a few walls to increase the security of her house, but in the limited time we had, we could not fix her roof. One of the hardest parts of this trip will be leaving, knowing I am going back to my cozy London flat while Patricia struggles to build a proper shelter for family.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">A smile goes a long way.&#xA0;</strong><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">&#xA0;</em></strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">I never knew I could feel so connected to so many people without ever saying a single word. Every day I looked forward to arriving at our house to be greeted by Patricia and her mom. Both of them have the most infectious smile that soon you realize you are beaming ear-to-ear returning the welcoming gesture of both gratitude and love. Even though we never really exchanged words other than through a translator, I feel more love for Patricia and her mom than I could ever have imagined. One of the days, Patricia&#x2019;s mom told our translator that our smiles brought so much joy to her that even when she was having a bad day she immediately felt better. I never really knew the power of a smile until this trip.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Laughter is a universal connection.</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">If I had 5 cents for every time someone on our team said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never laughed this hard in my life,&#x201D; I would be a rich, rich girl. Every day, no matter how hot the weather was or how hard the work became, we always found a way to laugh. We laughed with our families, we laughed with our Habitat hosts, we laughed on the bus, we laughed at the beach and we even laughed at all the weird noises (or uh, talents?) that each one of our team members could make (monkeys, dolphins, sea lions, beat boxing, just to name a few). After a week of laughter, 16 strangers have turned into my family from 10 countries. Thank you, laughter, for being the bond that brought us together.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Life is meant to be colorful.</strong><strong style=\"\">&#xA0;</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Walking down the streets of Recife, you can&#x2019;t help but notice all the colors. And I&#x2019;m not just talking about the color of the houses or buildings. What I mean by colorful is the feeling you get as you enter the community: music playing in the streets, colorful kites soaring high above you, soccer (or football!) balls kicked around by the children in the neighborhood as they chuckle down the street and of course, all the houses on the street that truly cover all the colors of the rainbow. Walking the streets of Recife has taught me to embrace life and to let my colors shine. Even though we were working in one of the poorest places in the world, the people were genuinely happy. Why? Because they embraced the colors of their community and truly allowed themselves to live.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I can honestly say this experience has changed me for the better. Thank you, thank you, thank you to all my fabulous teammates. You will always hold a special place in my life. I will be forever grateful to eBay and Habitat for giving me the experience of a lifetime. I vow to pay it forward and continue to find ways to help those in need. Today, I think I&#x2019;ll start with a smile.<span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

Since joining our teams together, we&#x2019;ve been working toward this mission and today, we&#x2019;re happy to announce the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://braintreepayments.com/v-zero\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Braintree v.zero SDK</a>&#xA0;-- our first product integration together that showcases our commitment to simplifying payments.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The Braintree v.zero SDK is the new foundation for accepting payments with Braintree, and for the first time gives businesses of all sizes a way to offer Pay with PayPal to their customers across platforms,&#xA0;<em style=\"\">without</em>&#xA0;needing to do a separate integration. People can pay with PayPal either on a one-time basis, or store their PayPal credentials for easy pre-approved future payments, without leaving the merchant&#x2019;s site.&#xA0;<span style=\"\">With the Braintree v.zero SDK, developers can also easily integrate a zero hassle, drop-in checkout experience in under 15 m</span>inutes and businesses with more specific needs can customize the checkout flow to reflect the particular look and feel they want.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The Braintree v.zero SDK has many other features and capabilities that we know our customers will love.

        "publishDate": "2015-05-23T07:00:00.000Z",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">July 10, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">By Catalina Girald, Founder and CEO,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.naja.co/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Naja</a></strong><br><br><span style=\"\">During my 18 months of backpacking through some of the most remote countries in the world, I was inspired by the women I met. I appreciated how each culture had its own way of sewing. It was a very social event where women gathered together and helped each other in different ways. I also admired that the women I met were so confident in their bodies. There was this sense of acceptance that I feel is missing in the United States. It led me to realize that if I had the right tools and resources, I could help inspire other women.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">That&#x2019;s why I started Naja:&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">to empower women through lingerie and create a culture where women help each other</strong>. We did away with the everyday model approach (fake wind-blown hair) and created a brand that highlighted the everyday woman instead: smart, courageous and sexy.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We always want to make sure we&apos;re giving women what they want, as well as something different&#x2014;something they wouldn&#x2019;t typically see in a department store. Naja undergarments are therefore characterized by extreme attention to detail, similar to that found in luxury brands. Examples include memory foam cups so your bra won&#x2019;t wrinkle when you travel, and interior prints for an extra special something. We think about what women want first and foremost, and the best part is we don&#x2019;t believe you should have to pay $80+ for a high quality bra. Our goal is to democratize good underwear for everyone &#x2013; and let every woman feel good in her body.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Underwear for a Purpose</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Naja&#x2019;s commitment to women extends beyond our customers. Through our partnership with the Golondrinas Foundation and our Underwear for Hope program, Naja helps educate single mothers so that they can learn marketable skills.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Additionally, a percentage of every purchase made on Naja.com goes toward supporting our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.naja.co/pages/underwear-for-hope\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">entrepreneurial sewing program for women</a>. And for every bra purchase, the proceeds go directly to the employment of a single mother. How it works: When you buy a bra, Naja gives you a lingerie wash bag so that you can wash your undergarments. Each lingerie bag is made at home by one of the women that we employ through&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.naja.co/pages/underwear-for-hope\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Underwear for Hope</a>.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Technology for Good</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We strive to give women the underwear that they want, when they want it, and to stay on top of fashion trends through technology.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">As I was gearing up to launching Naja, I held a Facebook focus group with 600 women to learn what they really wanted. Those insights (things like women&#x2019;s opinions on where lace should go or the different bra cup sizes we should offer) were put into our first collection, and proved to be invaluable.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Kickstarter has also been instrumental in growing Naja. We put in a bit of our own money and also raised some money to start producing our first collection, but we needed to raise just a little bit more to finish it off. We wanted to expand our range of sizing to include as many women as possible and also offer more choices for basic panties. I was able to reach my goal and knew that I had found my calling.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Lingerie and Beyond</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">I want to grow Naja to be more of a lifestyle brand that women can trust, and continue to empower the women who create our products. I can&#x2019;t wait to see where Naja goes next! I&#x2019;m excited for the journey and to continue to help women every step of the way.</span><br><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

Wearables are officially becoming fashionable. From the numerous collaborations we have seen between established designers and tech companies, it&#x2019;s obvious that the worlds of fashion and technology have met.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">But now there is a new kid on the wearable block. This new breed of designer creates beautiful accessories that also happen to be very smart. They&#x2019;re putting practicality, wearability, and affordability at the center of their design initiatives and coming up with gorgeously crafted accessories that any fashionista would want to wear&#x2014;techie or not.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One of these new kids that I have my eye on is Deepa Sood, the founder of&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.cuff.io/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Cuff</span></strong><span style=\"\">.</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;Her design concept came to her when she was lamenting with her girlfriends about how popular wearables didn&#x2019;t exactly stack well with the rest of their bracelets. Sood decided something had to be done about it, so she created a line of jewelry that looks like, well, jewelry. The only difference is that every piece in her Cuff collection has an interchangeable module called a &#x201C;Cufflinc,&#x201D; which connects to your phone. &#xA0;This module allows you to not only track your fitness, but to contact your inner circle if you need help, and to alert you with a vibration if you have an important phone call&#x2014;what more could you ask for from a cuff?</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Christina Mercando, an ebay alumnae, came up with her design before wearable technology was even a term. She was always missing calls and texts because her phone was buried in her purse. Then, one day, she looked at her cocktail rings and wondered why there couldn&#x2019;t be technology small enough to fit into those rings so she wouldn&#x2019;t have to miss a call again. Insert</span><a href=\"mailto:https://ringly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Ringly</span></strong></a><span style=\"\">, the collection of rings made out of 18K gold and semi-precious stones that will alert the wearer of a text, a call, or an email via vibration or a flashing light.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Then you have the handbags that integrate our devices into their designs:</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The&#xA0;</span><a href=\"mailto:https://everpurse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Everpurse,</span></strong></a><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span></strong><span style=\"\">the handbag line that magically charges your phone, wire-free, was conceptualized in 2011 by Liz Salcedo, a Chicago social worker who was frustrated that her phone would not stay charged all day when she was on the job (who can&#x2019;t relate to that?). After her Kickstarter campaign raised $238,000 the Everpurse appeared on the Today Show, Good Morning America, and in the pages of The New York Times. It was in demand before it was ever on the market&#x2014;when they were released in 2013, they sold out that same year. &#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Sydney Rogers, a 21-year old recent NYU grad came up with the&#xA0;</span><a href=\"mailto:http://www.sydneyrogersland.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">SYRO tote</span></strong></a><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">.&#xA0;</span></strong><span style=\"\">It<strong style=\"\">&#xA0;</strong>comes with the technology that<strong style=\"\">&#xA0;</strong>allows you&#xA0;to create graphics that will play on the exterior of the bag, meaning that it is an iPad carrier, stylish tote, and a moving piece of art all in one.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And then there are the hardcore tech brands that are just starting to make their own way in the fashion world, like&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">Withings</strong>. Known to be on the forefront of health and wearable technology, Withings just launched Activite, a classic (and very handsome) wristwatch, with technology hiding underneath.&#xA0;The Activit&#xE9; works like many fitness tracking devices; it keeps tabs on your activity levels, your sleep, and contains a silent, vibrating alarm.&#xA0;It just does it all without looking like it, which is the definition of cool.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">These new-to-the-fashion world designers have proved that it is possible to create gadgets that are, in fact, stylish and usable.&#xA0;The inspiring part is that four out of five of these brands were founded by intrepid women who were simply thinking of ways to make their own lives easier and more beautiful. &#xA0;And all of the brands did not sit back and wait for someone to create the products they wanted, they went out and did it themselves.&#xA0;&#xA0;As Steve Jobs once said: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go invent tomorrow instead of worrying about what happened yesterday.&#x201D; Like these emerging designers have proven, there&#x2019;s always room at the table for new, innovative ideas. The world is always looking for the next techie trailblazer.

The line for our face painters was never less than 30 people deep and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://fotobooth.me/peoplerule/2d6k4hs?s=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">our animated-gif photo booth</a>&#xA0;took more photos than anyone will ever be able to count.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">But beyond the hundreds of faces painted, prizes won and bracelets made, I think festival-goers most enjoyed the PayPal Convenience Store. Forgot your phone charger and your phone was about to die? No worries, you could buy a charger AND charge your phone at the tent. Beyond the &#x201C;convenience&#x201D; of the Convenience Store, my favorite part was that all the items were from local SF vendors.&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://raredevice.net/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Rare Device</span></a><span style=\"\">,&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://swaychic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">SwayChic</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;and&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.storenvy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">StoreEnvy</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;were just some of the local merchants that were part of the store. Not only were you getting stylish items (those wood-framed sunglasses were the talk of the Polo Field), but you were supporting local small businesses, which I think makes the items you purchased that much more special&#x2026;.and things you&#x2019;ll want to keep for years to come!</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Fast-forward one year and mobile device use is still continuing its explosive growth &#x2013; and has come to have an even greater impact on the ways we communicate, work and give. As smartphone and tablet adoption continues to climb, these &#x201C;smart&#x201D; devices are becoming even more integral to our daily lives, making it more important than ever for nonprofits to adopt a &#x201C;mobile-first&#x201D; strategy.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Consider the following facts from&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2665715\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Gartner</span></a><span style=\"\">: In 2013, more than 967 million smartphones were sold worldwide, surpassing sales of traditional feature phones. Additionally,&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/corporate/coverage\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">eMarketer</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;research also tells us that in the United States, it&#x2019;s expected that 163 million people &#x2013; 51% of the population &#x2013; will use a smartphone by end of 2014, and that the number will reach 220 million by 2018.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The numbers don&#x2019;t lie: we are becoming a mobile, always connected society. That means that people who are used to mobile communication, shopping and banking expect to have a similar easy-to-use experience with all the brands and organizations they encounter online. In fact, 61% of online adults&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://files.latd.com/Latitude-Next-Gen-Retail-Study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">surveyed</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;said that they have more favorable opinions of brands that offer good mobile experiences. This means that mobile users expect the sites they visit to be friendly and easy to navigate, from whatever device they use &#x2013; and if that&#x2019;s not the case, frustration easily leads to&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Whatrsquos-Upside-Shopping-Cart-Abandonment/1010646\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">site abandonment</span></a><span style=\"\">.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Luckily, for nonprofits looking to be where their donors are (and help them have the best experience), there&#x2019;s plenty of research on how to reduce frustration with the checkout experience and increase conversion, giving donors the seamless donation experience they are looking for. In fact, we&#x2019;ve partnered with Network for Good on a new white paper, &#x201C;</span><a href=\"http://learn.networkforgood.org/mobile-whitepaper-general.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Your Mission is Mobile</span></a><span style=\"\">,&#x201D; that includes a number of specific suggestions for optimizing mobile checkout processes for maximum donations.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Did you know that Network for Good and PayPal powered close to $20 billion in nonprofit payments in the last four years?

So how should executives make decisions strategically? asks Patrick Dupuis, chief financial officer (CFO) of PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Decision making is a powerful tool that can make or break a company. Some companies are known for their risk taking, others for playing it safe. As a CFO, I always find it challenging to strike the right balance between risk and opportunities, ambition and capabilities. After decades of taking and being on the receiving end of decisions day in and day out, I have gained enormous respect for the &#x201C;how&#x201D; of making decisions, especially in large, global organisations like eBay. The &#x201C;how&#x201D; of decision making involves sorting out who has a voice in the evaluation of decisions, who has the authority to take the final decision and who is accountable for delivering on the decision.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>One of the great challenges for any complex enterprise is the need to involve multiple groups and functions in the decision-making process, mainly so that everyone can benefit from the broad wisdom that exists across the organisation. Equally important is the need for everyone to align behind a decision once it has been made. There is an immense amount of time spent in the business world wavering on decisions or going back on an issue that had already been decided.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Setting Goals and Assigning Responsibility</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The first step in any decision-making process is to set clear (preferably externally focused) goals before convictions are formed. Whether it&#x2019;s growth in volume, customer satisfaction, employee engagement or income, reminding everyone of the end goal helps to keep organisations and individuals aligned throughout the process.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The second component that enables effective decision making is to name one person to be in charge overall of a decision at the outset. Ideally this person should not be a senior executive, but rather an expert within the field where this decision will eventually play out. There may be exceptions, for example initiatives on a more global scale may require broader reach in an organisation, which is more easily managed at a senior level.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This takes us to the third component, all the more critical when the decisions at hand are complex and highly cross-functional: the decision maker needs to be a leader with broad recognition across the enterprise, both among management and the broader team.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Innovative framework</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The framework we use at eBay (PayPal&#x2019;s parent company) for our most complicated and challenging initiatives is called I/O, or Initiatives and Owners. This process is designed to drive discipline, clarity and accountability around cross-functional business imperatives. The concept of designating an owner who is considered responsible for an initiative isn&apos;t new, but the most telling benefit of the I/O process is the increased level of collaboration and engagement that it has created across the enterprise.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Part of the increased collaboration comes from having more transparency in the decision-making process throughout the organisation, supporting a leadership culture that has clear and defined goals with regular reporting. In addition, we provide a forum where it is safe and expected for managers to be honest with senior leaders about progress and concerns. Finally, because we have a monthly review for each I/O in front of the entire leadership team, we have lessened the occurrence of &#x201C;dissonance&#x201D; between executives who are not directly involved in the management of the project.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Team Effort and Delegation</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Bringing in decision making across all levels within a company, and not from the top down, requires a leadership shift. Effective decisions are not just made by a one-man team, at the highest levels of the company, but by a team effort with more delegation of authority at the right level, closer to the action.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>All of which leads to the fourth component for successful decision making: the need for I/Os to be centered on the customer. Although the end goal should always be used as a guide, the most important measurement should be an evaluation of whether the right thing is being done for the customer.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Not all decisions need an I/O, but every leader can benefit from I/O principles. Every project can yield better results if there is clear alignment and transparency so that leaders are empowered to ask the right questions. By working in this way, companies will not only see better collaboration within their teams, they will also find new ways of engaging with customers to make them part of the decision-making process too.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"></span><br><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">August 06, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Bill Ready, CEO, Braintree</strong><br><br><span style=\"\">It&#x2019;s possible, but data security and other obstacles are getting in the way of a truly hyper-connected world.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Mobile is playing a bigger role in the world, and as it does, it&#x2019;s enabling some profound shifts in how we live. Soon, our mobile devices &#x2013; from smartphones to wearables &#x2013; will know so much about us that they will transform into personal mobile concierges and be able to seamlessly transact on our behalf without prompting. We&#x2019;re already moving toward this hyper-connected world &#x2013; toward the Internet of Things &#x2013; where machine-to-machine communications will soon outpace human-to-machine conversations. But for this connected world to work as seamlessly as many envision, it requires much more than just technology that can predict our wants and needs.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">For one, it requires an open and secure, developer-friendly platform &#x2014; one that is linked together through a cross-platform mobile payments OS. Startups need to be able to quickly move through hundreds of failures before ultimately finding the product or service that resonates with consumers. Today&#x2019;s most successful startups at one point had to iterate and pivot based on critical feedback from the market. Before Instagram and Flickr became the successful businesses they are today, for example, they both started out with completely different business models but evolved their businesses in response to market feedback.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Security is also paramount. There&#x2019;s both a need to reduce friction &#x2014; like removing passwords and enabling logins with the touch of finger &#x2014; and increase security. In order for young startups to be able to get feedback, customers need to be able to trust that their data &#x2014; whether it&#x2019;s passwords or payment information &#x2014; won&#x2019;t be compromised. This is especially important as devices become increasingly connected and information gets quickly passed around from one service or device to the next. Customers need to trust that if their refrigerator gets hacked, sensitive data like their credit card information won&#x2019;t be compromised.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Finally, this all needs to be connected through an agnostic payments OS &#x2014; one that isn&#x2019;t confined to a specific platform &#x2014; that will enable and authenticate purchases. It&#x2019;s great that your fridge can ping your smartphone when you&#x2019;re out of eggs or need to pick up some milk, but imagine if your fridge could seamlessly make the order for you. This in the next step in connected commerce.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Today, 1.9 billion devices are already connected to the Internet and it&#x2019;s estimated that by 2020, we&#x2019;ll reach</span><a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2602817\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;30 billion connected devices globally</span></a><span style=\"\">. As we shift toward a world where our smartphones are now our primary computing devices, we&#x2019;re moving from what some call an &#x201C;on-demand world,&#x201D; to what I see as an &#x201C;at your service world&#x201D; &#x2013; where our devices know what we want, when we want it, and can initiate things on our behalf. From buying through to shipping, technology will be able to deliver these magical experiences without people having to drive the interaction. This is the future of Smart Commerce.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Technologies already exist that enable people to pay across mobile apps with a single touch, or make a purchase without even taking out a wallet or phone thanks to beaconing technology. But that&#x2019;s just the beginning. Soon, our mobile devices &#x2013; with access to everything from geo-location information to purchase history to biometric data &#x2014; will know enough about us that they&#x2019;ll be able to facilitate not just a single transaction, but trigger a chain of transactions and experiences without prompting. Our devices will not only know our past activity, but also learn our habits and routines and begin to anticipate and predict our needs and preferences.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Imagine a future where your connected wearable device, which tracks your physical activity, identifies that you haven&#x2019;t been as active this week as you typically are. As a result, it connects with your grocery and/or meal delivery service and orders healthier, low-calorie options for the week &#x2014; knowing from your past purchase data that you like carrots and Brussels sprouts but would never eat broccoli. These experiences may seem magical now, but soon they&#x2019;ll be a routine part of our lives. In fact, earlier this month,&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://blog.munchery.com/2014/07/eating-better-nutritional-tracking/?utm_campaign=daily_menu&amp;utm_source=daily_menu&amp;utm_medium=email\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Munchery, one of our customers, and Jawbone announced a partnership</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;allowing Munchery customers to track the nutritional data in their meals on their Jawbone Up app. Now it&#x2019;s not so hard to imagine how a partnership like this could play out in the real world.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The connected Internet of Things is rapidly becoming reality. But in order to realize the full potential of a truly connected world, we first need to put into place the foundational fabric on top of which the Internet of Things will exist.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Bill Ready is CEO of&#xA0;</span></em><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blogs\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><em style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Braintree</span></em></a><em style=\"\"><span style=\"\">,</span></em><em style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;a company that helps online businesses process online and mobile payments.

But PayPal and MAPCO -- one of the largest convenience store chains in the southeast -- are about to change that. Today, MAPCO announced that they have launched the MY MAPCO app on&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://mapcomartblog.com/MapcoApp/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">iOS&#xAE; and Android</span></a><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#x2122;</span></span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;- bringing customers a convenient and secure way to pay at the pump using their mobile devices. PayPal is the exclusive payment option in the MY MAPCO app and is currently available in 276 MAPCO locations across the U.S.<br><br>With the MY MAPCO app, people in&#xA0;<span style=\"\">Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee</span>&#xA0;can pay for gas on their mobile phones without ever needing to open up their wallets. And as an added benefit, consumers using the app will get five cents back on every gallon filled*. With average gas prices in 2014 averaging&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.fuelgaugereport.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">$3.49 per gallon and the average American using 533 gallons</span></a><span style=\"\">&#xA0;of gas per year, the five cents back per gallon gives drivers a chance to save nearly $100 per year on gas.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">For consumers who are increasingly connected to their mobile phones, this makes the paying process much more quick and seamless (not to mention cheaper), giving them a&#xA0;better experience. It also makes the transaction more secure by helping avoid fraudulent transactions, as it eliminates the need to publicly share credit card information or&#xA0;carry large amounts of cash.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">For businesses, offering consumers a seamless and secure way to pay encourages customer loyalty.

While culture was once viewed as something that emerged organically without thought or intention, there is a growing realization that culture plays a key role in the success or failure of organizations. Companies that are thoughtful in shaping their culture reap many benefits, such as the ability to attract and retain top talent and nurture loyal, satisfied customers.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">People Over Process</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One of the biggest indicators of a vibrant workplace culture is the willingness of a company to place more value on its people than on process. People are the prize - and organizations that&#xA0;recognize that will earn a competitive advantage over ones that stay focused on process. This people-centric view can be thought of as the &#x201C;people economy,&#x201D; a term that acknowledges the vital role individuals play in organizational success.&#xA0;In the people economy, employees aren&#x2019;t viewed merely as headcount, but rather as the engine that spurs innovation, drives market growth, satisfies customers, and builds brand value.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Technology plays an important role in the people economy, allowing&#xA0;companies to explore new ways of working that meet the needs of today&#x2019;s diverse workforce. Technologies such as cloud computing, collaboration software, and mobile&#xA0;devices, enable new levels of flexibility and control and help people perform at their best.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Principles of the People Economy</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">What should organizations keep in mind as they navigate the people economy? At Workiva, we&#x2019;ve developed a few high-level guidelines that we believe are fundamental to building a workplace&#xA0;culture that attracts and rewards a company&#x2019;s most important asset: its people.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Develop policies and ways of working that put people first.&#xA0;</span></strong><span style=\"\">When people are given an active role in deciding how they work, they are more likely to view their relationship&#xA0;to the company in a positive way. Create more buy-in from your people by encouraging open dialogue and collaboration, inviting feedback, and valuing innovative ideas.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Choose tools and solutions that enable creativity without sacrificing security.&#xA0;</span></strong><span style=\"\">Tools and solutions that are well designed and easy to use make a big difference in how people feel about their work. It also improves their productivity. Look for solutions developed with users in mind, and choose cloud-based software that offers enterprise-level security while allowing people to connect anywhere at any time.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Enable more flexibility in working arrangements.&#xA0;</span></strong><span style=\"\">The traditional &#x201C;9-to-5&#x201D; office model is an outdated, rigid arrangement that serves a limited set of people. In a global economy driven by disparate workers, companies can be far&#xA0;more flexible about where and when people work, allowing HR to find the&#xA0;best talent, regardless of location. When the&#xA0;focus is on results, rather&#xA0;than on the times when people work, everyone wins.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Spend time on the numbers that really matter.&#xA0;</span></strong><span style=\"\">Many performance metrics are not designed with people in mind. Take a closer look at what you&#x2019;re measuring - and determine whether they truly align with your culture and your business goals.&#xA0;</span></li></ul><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;</span></strong>A company thrives when its people thrive. Happier people make better products and services. In turn, they build stronger, more resilient companies. By taking an active role in the people&#xA0;economy, organizations can cultivate a&#xA0;workforce that feels valued, challenged, and fulfilled. And that&#x2019;s good for everyone.<br></div>\n\n\t\t",

We focus on one simple thing that can make an immediate and tangible difference for students and schools.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><strong>What are some of your biggest challenges in getting support?&#xA0;</strong><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"\">Our biggest challenges are letting people who care about music know we exist and conveying how important the arts are in education. It inspires creativity and helps kids in reading and math &#x2013; helps them socialize and become more confident. The message is so important and it&#x2019;s challenging getting through the noise and getting noticed in a big way. StubHub, which, like PayPal, is a part of the eBay Inc. family, has helped so much. They have the platform to really effect social change through their messaging and range of options for their fans and customers. As one of StubHub&#x2019;s Rising Stars, we have an advantage in reaching and educating more people about the impact of music education and how it can launch kids in school into successful careers and happier lives.

Nowadays they could be a bank, postal service, money transfer business, stored valued account, virtual currency, or a mobile payments platform.</span><br><span style=\"\"><br></span><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The Asian Development Bank Institute estimates a country&#x2019;s payments costs (in ASEAN) can be 3% of Gross Domestic Product GDP, and if there is a shift from fully paper-based to fully electronic-based payment system, cost savings at 1% of GDP can be realized.&#xA0;Yet regulations governing payments are based in the pre-Internet era, and have been updated as a catch up, rather than to encompass future developments.&#xA0;<br></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Asia is the focal point&#xA0; - not only because of the varying levels of ePayments penetration across the region, but because&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">for the first time, consumers in Asia-Pacific will spend more on ecommerce purchases than those in North America. Making it the largest regional eCommerce market in the world (<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/forums/postpage/board-id/Why%20we%20need%20ePayments%20harmonization\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">source</a>).&#xA0;<br><br></span><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">With more eCommerce purchases, naturally there&apos;s going to be an increase in ePayments.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">ePayments harmonization does not mean creating the same law in different countries, it&#x2019;s about setting a common or even minimal standards when it applies to regulating ePayments. For example, efforts in harmonization have been attempted in relation to product standards through the&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">World Trade Organization and International Organization for Standardization.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">There are three key reasons why we need ePayments harmonization among different countries in Asia.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Financial Inclusion</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">More than a third of the world&#x2019;s population are excluded from the financial sector, and it has been demonstrated that ePayments is more secure, transparent, cost efficient and help enables financial inclusion.<br><br></span><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Financial inclusion helps SMEs access to markets they previously never had access to, and helps consumers receive funds in a secure way, that can be more cost efficient.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Risk-Based Approach</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Traditionally, Know Your Customer or KYC is done face-to-face. And banks, remittance agents, money-changers and financial institutions will ask for a photocopy of your National ID and a photocopy of your utilities bills or cable-TV bills. It is a one-time deal triggered by certain threshold being reached. And it is susceptible to forgery and identity theft.&#xA0;<br><br>Some cross-border transactions, depending on their value and your geographical location, may trigger Anti-Money Laundering threshold set by the local government and the KYC process is instigated. Thresholds per transaction varies from country to country.<br><br>This means that I have to scan copies of my National ID and send them to that payment provider facilitating the transaction. Wait a couple of days for their review before the payment instruction was carried out. In the meantime, the merchant whom I purchased the product is chasing me up on payments and wondering if I have had cold feet. Now, imagine this happening hundreds and thousands of times each week. What kind of compliance costs are imposed on us? And more importantly, what kind of customer experience will that produce for your citizens?<br><br>A model that leverages big data more effectively and take a risk-based approach to KYC using multiple data points can better address this situation. These data points could include your IP address, your smart device&#x2019;s unique identification code, your geo-location based on the nearest WiFi&#x2019;s IP address and GPS &#x2013; of course all encrypted and within the boundaries of acceptable data collection methods.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Authentication</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We are moving in a direction beyond passwords.<br><br></span><span style=\"\">Authentication is becoming increasingly challenging for users. Industry statistics show that many people simply reuse the same password everywhere and most of the rest have only three or four passwords that are reused everywhere. This means that users&#x2019; security is more vulnerable to malware, phishing and identity theft.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">At PayPal, we believe that our customers deserve authentication solutions that are both strong and easy to use.&#xA0;</span>At the same time, there are different forms of payments authentication in different markets with no regional consistency:<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">3-D Secure</span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;(3DS) is an XML-based protocol designed to be an additional security layer for online credit and debit card transactions.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Two Factor Authentication is</span><strong style=\"\">&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"\">a process involving two subsequent but dependent stages to check the identity of an entity trying to access online services.</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">B</span><span style=\"\">iometric authentication uses your fingerprint on certain mobile phones to verify your payments account.</span></li></ul><span style=\"\">PayPal also co-founded the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">FIDO Alliance</a>&#xA0;to address some of these issues.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance is a non-profit organization to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication devices as well as the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\"><br></span><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">ePayments harmonization will help set the standard and set the foundation for sensible regulation.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

We helped festival-goers go cashless at&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Music-amp-Tech-Experience-Governors-Ball-with-PayPal/ba-p/821884\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Governors Ball</span></a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Music-amp-Tech-PayPal-s-Going-to-Bonnaroo-Are-You/ba-p/824052\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Bonnaroo</span></a>, and now we&#x2019;re gearing up for&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.sfoutsidelands.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Outside Lands</span></a><span style=\"\">,</span>&#xA0;right in our back yard, in two weeks.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Through all of these experiences, we&#x2019;ve been able to implement PayPal technology with various vendors to make paying for food and your favorite band t-shirt the last thing you have to worry about when all you want to do is enjoy the music. It was great to see festival-goers get excited over the fact that they could buy everything from Momokufu treats at Governors Ball to BLT sandwiches at Bonnaroo&#x2019;s Baconland &#x2013; all with their phones!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But what if you could pay&#xA0;<em style=\"\">without</em>&#xA0;your phone?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>That&#x2019;s what we are testing at the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lowfestival.es/information-and-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Low Festival</a>&#xA0;in Benidorm this weekend.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With the help of special RFID bracelets synched to festival-goers<span style=\"\">&#x2019;</span>&#xA0;PayPal accounts,&#xA0; people in the VIP sections of the Low Festival will be truly cashless &#x2013; all you have to do is tap your RFID bracelet on the register and presto: payment complete! &#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">One of the places you can use the bracelet to pay is the VIP pool area, not somewhere you want to be flashing your smartphone around. Accidents do happen and my phone is far from waterproof.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#xA0;&#xA0;As I ponder how technology will continue to impact not only how people consume music, but how it enhances everyday life, I&#x2019;m always struck by the idea of &#x201C;cashless&#x201D; experiences. I doubt cash will ever become completely extinct, but it&#x2019;s clear that &#x201C;cashless&#x201D; is not just something people want&#x2013; it&#x2019;s becoming the norm. &#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I&#x2019;m just sorry that I couldn&#x2019;t make it to Benidorm this weekend, to experience the pool party myself!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

We have offices in communities nationwide working on research, advocacy, support and awareness. We&#x2019;ve been helping families and funding research for about 30 years and have already seen incredible advances in the understanding of this devastating disease from the perspectives of both research and care and support &#x2013; but we have a long way to go, and 5.4 million Americans (and their families) to serve! There is hope on the horizon and we are leading the way to a world without Alzheimer&#x2019;s!</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">What makes your organization unique?</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We are unique because we take a big-picture, strategic approach to end this disease and its devastating effect on families: We are the largest private, nonprofit funder of Alzheimer&#x2019;s research; at the same time, we are driving the grassroots movement to end Alzheimer&#x2019;s through advocacy and awareness; we mobilize communities nationwide at Walk to End Alzheimer&#x2019;s; we are square one for education, and thousands of families reach out to us for help and support every day. Caring for someone with Alzheimer&#x2019;s isn&#x2019;t easy, but reaching us is, and while there is no encyclopedia for this disease, we are helping families get on the right page.&#xA0;</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">What are some of your biggest challenges in serving your mission?</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We currently see an unfathomable approach to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease &#x2013; lots of denial and misunderstandings about the disease from health professionals, as well as communities and families. We sum it up in one word: STIGMA. People often think memory loss is just a normal part of aging, but Alzheimer&#x2019;s is a progressive brain disease that causes severe memory loss and so much more. It kills more people each year than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. It has no cure, no means of prevention, there is no way to even slow this disease. While we do see Alzheimer&#x2019;s cases in people as young as 40, the risk of getting the disease increases with age &#x2013; and seniors are often a forgotten and neglected population. The Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association is leading the movement to change people&#x2019;s understanding of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and we are making progress, but we need more people to open their eyes to the&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.alz.org/facts\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">facts about Alzheimer&#x2019;s</span></a><span style=\"\">.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">How is PayPal Here helping you to collect donations?</span></strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We use PayPal Here to take donations at our fundraising events such as Walk to End Alzheimer&#x2019;s. Equipping the volunteers was remarkably easy. We set up PayPal accounts for them before the event, so they arrived with the app already on their devices.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And they needed very little training &#x2013; everyone found the app super easy to use.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Roving donations were also embraced by walkers and other event attendees. I had one 80-year-old donor who was amazed at the technology. He had already made a gift at another walk, but wanted to donate again with the PayPal Here device.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">We were also able to save on the cost of renting credit-card machines and were able to capture more spontaneous donations thanks to the roaming volunteers.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Would you recommend PayPal to another nonprofit? Why?</span></strong><br><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Yes!

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">July 29, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Sheryl Gong, Marketing, PayPal</strong><br><br><span style=\"\">&#x201C;Buying a knife is like buying a new pair of shoes,&#x201D; Denise Nelson, the General Manager of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.perfectedgesharpening.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Perfect Edge</a>, told me as I perused the endless wall of knives. &#x201C;You have to try it on and see how it fits,&#x201D; she said as she handed me the handle of a lightweight Gyuto Japanese knife that fit perfectly in my hand. &#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Mike Solaegui, the owner and founder of Perfect Edge, also shared some useful shopping advice as we chatted. &#x201C;When you buy fruit, you should buy it from a produce stand. When you buy meat, you should buy it from a butcher. And when you buy knives, you should buy them from a knife store,&#x201D; he said, explaining that to get the best quality for anything you buy, you should go straight to the source.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Here at Perfect Edge, they are experts in cutlery and knife sharpening and it&#x2019;s obvious that they really know their stuff. Last week our PayPal team was on location to film an interview with Mike as he told us why he loves PayPal Here and how it has helped his business grow. Here are just a few behind-the-scenes pictures from the shoot:</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Just like his father, Mike started his career as a butcher and realized that there was a growing demand for good quality knife sharpening, as many of his customers would frequently bring in their knives to be sharpened. He then retired from the meat business and decided to create his very own cutlery-sharpening machine and Perfect Edge was born. With the boom of mobile trucks, he decided to take his business on the road, and now services more than 800 hotels and restaurants throughout Northern California.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Unlike the &#x201C;cutting&#x201D; edge technology that he had created, he realized that taking payments on his mobile truck was still a challenge.&#xA0;His previous credit card processing system was expensive and inconvenient, so he started using PayPal Here and now taking payments on his truck has never been faster and easier! He told us during the shoot, &#x201C;Now we can fly!&#x201D;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Despite being a little intimated by technology, he couldn&#x2019;t believe how easy it was to use and now recommends it to many of his friends and colleagues. He simply carries the card reader in one pocket and his cell phone in the other, taking payments instantly and on the spot, which is great when he&#x2019;s on-the-go at places like farmers&#x2019; markets. Now he can take all credit card types and regardless of the card, it&#x2019;s the same, simple fee - 2.7% per swipe, which is great for his business and, more importantly, makes his customers happy (not to mention, they feel more secure with a name that they can trust).</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">At 66 years old, Mike is still as sharp as a Wusthof blade and has successfully expanded his business both nationally and internationally, and has no plans to retire anytime soon. If&#xA0;you&#x2019;re lucky, maybe you&#x2019;ll see his truck at your local farmers&#x2019; market!</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

I joined Bill Me Later with eBay (PayPal) in 2008, because we shared a common vision to make shopping and paying easy, flexible and convenient. So today, we are announcing the evolution of Bill Me Later to PayPal Credit, and the exceptional growth of PayPal Working Capital----a global portfolio of credit solutions that help people and businesses leap forward. &#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">PayPal Credit Evolves and Plans to Expand to the UK and Germany&#xA0;</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>As people and businesses know and trust the PayPal name, this is a natural and logical brand transformation. It also demonstrates how we are&#xA0;moving credit more towards the center of our business, aligning it more closely with our overall brand, and working as a partner with businesses to spur growth. Our customers and merchants across the pond have been asking for the flexibility and convenience of PayPal Credit in their markets, so&#xA0;today we&#x2019;re also announcing that we plan to introduce PayPal Credit to the UK and Germany. People will begin to see PayPal in places they haven&#x2019;t seen before, allowing shoppers to easily make purchases with financial flexibility. &#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">PayPal Working Capital Has Funded More Than $150 Million in Loans to 20,000 US Businesses</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Since the pilot program launched last September, more than 20,000 businesses have collectively borrowed more than $150 million in PayPal Working Capital business loans through our lending partner, WebBank. The program is also expanding to the UK and Australia to fuel business growth. Businesses in these countries will have access to capital in minutes once they apply and are approved through a simple online interface. PayPal Working Capital allows these businesses to repay with a share of their sales they choose, and don&#x2019;t repay on days they don&#x2019;t have sales. Because the program uses a business&#x2019;s sales history, there is no credit check or extensive documentation required. The loan charges a single, affordable fixed fee instead of periodic interest so businesses know the cost of the loan up front. It&#x2019;s that simple.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Evolving Credit Landscape&#xA0;</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Offering these products more broadly is a sign of the power that credit brings to both merchants and consumers. Merchants can leverage credit as a tool to secure capital and grow their businesses. Additionally, they can offer credit with flexible payments options for their customers and immediate sales, while consumers experience freedom of choice when buying what they want &#x2013; when they want it.&#xA0; We recognize this value isn&#x2019;t limited to our US customers, so we are going global.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But it&#x2019;s less important for me to tell you about how great this product is and more important for you to hear it from the merchants themselves who have seen their business grow directly as a result of offering credit or receiving capital through PayPal Working Capital:<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><em style=\"\">PayPal Working Capital: &#x201C;I would recommend PayPal Working Capital to other business owners because it gives you a quick, easy way to get access to money to grow your business.&#x201D; &#x2013; Steve&#xA0;</em>Contratto, owner of CF Sales</li></ul><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><em style=\"\">PayPal Credit: &#x201C;We love to use PayPal because it&#x2019;s brought some new pieces to our business.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">July 31, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Jay Strut, Fashion Blogger, jaystrut.com</strong><br><br><span style=\"\">I&#x2019;ll let you in on my little secret: thanks to innovations like Instagram, anyone can be a self-made, self-taught &#x201C;brand&#x201D; in the digital age. You don&#x2019;t have to wait for anyone to say yes or no to you &#x2013; there are no more gatekeepers or barriers.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">So, to rewind for a second, how exactly did I, just an ordinary boy from Toronto, find my voice (and over 25,000 followers) on&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/jaystrut\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Instagram</span></a><span style=\"\">? It all started with the need for a place to spontaneously share my thoughts, passions and fashion obsessions. I was early to&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.jaystrut.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">fashion blogging</span></a><span style=\"\">, my first&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">real form of independent expression</span><span style=\"\">.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">I even taught myself how to do HTML coding around 12-13 so I could have a custom website</span><span style=\"\">, but once Instagram came around, that&#x2019;s when I really hit my stride. I didn&#x2019;t have to wait until I had computer and Wi-Fi to share my favorite snaps from a runway show or someone&#x2019;s killer street style I spotted that day. Instagram enabled, well,&#xA0;<em style=\"\">instant</em>touchpoints with my growing readership and fan base.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Instagram: Today&#x2019;s Vision Board</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Instagram has never been all about me, me, me. (Of course, I like to indulge in a selfie or two, or ten! But hey, who doesn&apos;t these days?) From day one, I saw this platform as a vision board with a social spin &#x2013; a shared collection of images that inspire me and inform my evolving aesthetic tastes. Whether it&#x2019;s fashion, accessories, architecture, food, people &#x2013; all of these visual elements come together to reflect moods, observations and ideas that I want to share and enjoy with others.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">And it&#x2019;s funny &#x2013; looking back, my first few posts are basically the same as today: just me going gaga over things I thought were cool. This is what I credit a lot of my &#x201C;DIY fame&#x201D; success to, and what I have never changed: my perspective and point-of-view. This is how I&#x2019;ve differentiated myself, from the beginning of my blogging career and early Instagram days through now. While a lot of fashion bloggers write like they&#x2019;re composing SAT essays, my voice is more&#xA0;<em style=\"\">5th avenue housewife at a 70% off sale at Bergdorf Goodman</em>.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Beating Back the Doubt</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Of course, along the path to self-made success there are roadblocks along the way &#x2013; self-doubt being the biggest of them all. I can remember many sleepless nights, asking myself where this could lead. Not knowing if this whole fashion blogger thing was something that was going to work out. Not knowing if this was worth not being in school. Not knowing if this would be better than a regular retail job. There are always going to be haters out there, but it&#x2019;s crazy how easy it is to let self-doubt seep in. Before you know it, you&#x2019;ve become your own worst enemy.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">What got me through it? Ultimately it was connection. My devoted readership, all the people who encouraged me to continue sharing my world with them, were invaluable. My mentors also played a huge part, though I don&#x2019;t mean &#x201C;mentors&#x201D; in the traditional sense. These are people I continue to watch, listen and learn from. People I don&apos;t know personally, but they inspire me by leading by example &#x2013; from the way they carry themselves to the way they engage with others: self-assured, fearless, opinionated.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Sudden Fame</span></strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">I knew I had finally &#x201C;made it&#x201D; when cool designers started reaching out to&#xA0;<em style=\"\">me</em>. First, Stefano Gabanna of Dolce &amp; Gabanna tweeted me and said that he liked my blog (I still have it favorited somewhere on my Twitter). This was a really cool; it was my first real moment of recognition from someone in the fashion industry who was at the top of the game. Then came the social media love from the Marc Jacobs team. The next thing I knew I was in their office in New York on Spring St. getting a tour and watching Marc himself style looks the day before a show! #TeenageDream</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Fast forward to today: I&#x2019;m jet setting all over the world to collaborate with top fashion and lifestyle brands and documenting it all on Instagram. But every time I share a new photo, it never fails to be a &#x201C;pinch me&#x201D; moment &#x2013; I&#x2019;m immediately reminded of the powerful human connection that exists on the other end of that image. I wouldn&#x2019;t be where I am today without those 25,000+ people who eagerly await my next Instagram snap. I really believe that my &#x201C;story&#x201D; &#x2013; a boy from Toronto from humble beginnings who turned a lifelong passion for fashion into a career and personal brand &#x2013; wouldn&#x2019;t be possible without social media.&#xA0;</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">You already have the tools at our fingertips (literally!) to share the ideas, vision and creativity that make you, YOU &#x2013; so what are you waiting for?

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">October 16, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Hill Ferguson, SVP, Chief Product Officer, PayPal</strong><br><br>It&#x2019;s a little known fact but back when the company was called Confinity, our first business model was a mobile only one &#x2013; beaming money between Palm III PDAs. PayPal (the product) was an offshoot of that business that allowed a payment to be sent, quickly and easily to anyone&#x2019;s email address. The first PayPal transaction on record was sent on October 16,1999 &#x2013; fifteen years ago today.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The move from Palm Pilots to email payments was PayPal&#x2019;s first pivot and it helped change the nature of ecommerce, by providing a quick and easy way for people like you and me to pay and get paid safely and securely over the Internet. PayPal was such a successful product that we renamed the company after it in June 2001 and we have continued to adapt to help take advantage of upcoming opportunities ever since.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Although I&#x2019;ve only been with PayPal for three years, I speak on behalf of the company when I say that it&#x2019;s incredible to see how far we&#x2019;ve come. Since 1999, PayPal has weathered the dot.com bust, seen technology come and go, and broken new ground in the fight against cybercrime. As a global leader, serving 203 markets around the world and accepting payments in more than 100 different currencies, we&#x2019;re again seeing the landscape of payments and commerce shift.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It&#x2019;s ironic, yet fitting, that the first PayPal transactions occurred on Palm Pilots, which are now defunct. That the very platform we built our first business on is extinct, but we&#x2019;re still growing.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And its because of the crucial driver of our success: the ability to pivot, evolve, and adapt to&#xA0;<em style=\"\">huge&#xA0;</em>changes in the industry &#x2013; whether a new handheld device (or highly competitive category of them), an economic downturn, or even a new currency (yes, the Euro was not yet widely adopted when PayPal launched).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A few examples of key turns:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">2006, as infatuation with cellphones grew, we let people pay by SMS, well in advance of the advent of the iPhone&#xAE; (though we were there in the first App Store&#xAE;, too&#x2026;)</li><li style=\"\">2008, as the economy softened, we launched the PayPal Student Account, to ease tension between parents and teens around money exchange, while giving teens the chance to learn&#xA0;good spending habits&#xA0;and experience being&#xA0;responsible&#x2026; a fancy way of saying that even back then, we were powering the People Economy in the way our customers needed us most.</li><li style=\"\">In 2009, we were the first to open up our global platform to allow third party developers to build secure, reliable payments directly into their apps.</li><li style=\"\">In 2010 we fed the public&#x2019;s love of Facebook by becoming a payment option for Facebook Credits.</li><li style=\"\">And in 2012, we launched the first cloud-based in-store payments capabilities with the Home Depot.</li></ul>Every company has a corporate DNA and for us it is payments. Making payments work at scale takes great technology combined with the highest security standards and customer support. We are the world&#x2019;s most trusted digital wallet because we give people the flexibility to pay in hundreds of different ways.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Yes, we&#x2019;ve come a long way in fifteen years. But we&#x2019;re not done evolving and we&#x2019;re not done innovating. 58 product experiences in 2013 and we have already surpassed that number this year. In the last 12 months, we acquired Braintree, the leading mobile payment platform, launched fingerprint authentication for payments with Samsung and announced our affiliation with Bitcoin.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">October 14, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">James Barrese, CTO, PayPal</strong><br><br>Today, details of an Internet security protocol vulnerability were released, which many in the industry are calling &#x201C;POODLE&#x201D;. The vulnerability impacts a protocol called SSL 3.0, which was designed to ensure secure connections when surfing on the Internet.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>When exploited, this vulnerability enables a cyber criminal to gain access to connections considered secure via this widespread (but 15-year-old) security protocol. The&#xA0;Information Security community has collaboratively analyzed this issue and the&#xA0;Google security team&#xA0;reported&#xA0;it&#xA0;<a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">earlier today through a very helpful blog post</a>describing the vulnerability and offering a near and long-term solution for their users along with a recommendation for how the rest of the Internet should respond.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As a bit of background to help you understand the complexity and widespread impact of this vulnerability, nearly all Internet browsers support SSL 3.0. Though most companies doing business on the Internet have adopted its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), older browser versions and some legacy Internet experiences leverage SSL 3.0 to maintain secure connections. Also, some modern browsers will &#x201C;fall back&#x201D; to SSL 3.0 in certain situations.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV</a>&#xA0;is an option for the more secure TLS protocol that prevents &#x201C;fall back&#x201D; to SSL 3.0 and PayPal is in the process right now to ensure that all connections leverage this option as appropriate.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So far, we&#x2019;ve determined that we must disable SSL 3.0 support as soon as we reasonably can. Unfortunately, this necessary step may cause compatibility problems for a few of our customers resulting in the inability to pay with PayPal on some merchant sites or other processing issues that we are still identifying. However, we can&#x2019;t stress enough that this short-term inconvenience is heavily outweighed by the PayPal brand promise of keeping our customers and their money safe. For us, it&#x2019;s that simple.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today, we have absolutely no evidence that any of our customers have been compromised by this vulnerability. We pledge to stay transparent and let you know if we discover anything else. For now, thank you for continuing to trust us and know that we will do everything to protect your financial details as we&#x2019;ve done for many years. If you have concerns, don&#x2019;t hesitate to reach out.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the coming days, we will remove support for SSL 3.0 completely. We plan to keep our customers up to date on how we are addressing this issue via the appropriate channels including&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/bg-p/PPFWD\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PayPal Forward</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskPayPal\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">our Twitter handle</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/helphub/home/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Customer Service</a>&#xA0;and for merchants, through our Merchant Services team.

The headlines can be concerning, so I wanted to share some information about what PayPal does to combat this type of crime and why there may be more spoof emails than usual.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What are spoof emails and what is phishing?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Spoof emails are designed to look like they come from a trusted company like PayPal, but are actually sent by criminals trying to trick you into revealing your login and password details.

Simply put, criminals need to send more emails to try to find victims, because their efforts are becoming less and less successful. The criminals know that fewer of their fake emails are able to get to potential victims and their fake web sites are being shut down at a rate that makes it challenging to steal as many login credentials as before.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">How can you join the fight against phishing?</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We are pleased that we are keeping our customers safer through these efforts, but we need your support in the fight against phishing.

        "publishDate": "2015-05-22T07:00:00.000Z",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">October 24, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Anuj&#xA0;Nayar, Senior Director of Global Initiatives, PayPal</strong><br><br>For many, Halloween next Friday kicks off the start of the unofficial holiday season. As soon as the ghouls and spider webs are put away, they are replaced by Thanksgiving turkeys and pumpkin pie. Many US retailers don&#x2019;t even wait for Thanksgiving Day to end before they kick off their Black Friday sales.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Since $1 in every $6 of ecommerce flows through PayPal, we have a unique perspective and can identify shopping trends before others in the industry. One trend we&#x2019;ve recently noticed is particularly interesting. 2012 marked the first year that we saw the beginning of the holiday shopping season kick off on Sept 30th&#x2014;a full month before Halloween. But Thanksgiving came super early that year (on November 22<span style=\"\">nd</span>). What surprised us is that Sept 30<span style=\"\">th</span>&#xA0;marked the beginning of the shopping season in 2013 too, even though that year Thanksgiving came late (on November 28<span style=\"\">th</span>). Our early data indicates that 2014 is following the same trend.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ve analyzed PayPal&#x2019;s year-on-year data, and found that 2014&#x2019;s US holiday shopping season has already kicked off. According to our data, the US holiday shopping season began sometime between 6 PM to 7 PM PDT, on September 30. We&#x2019;ve noticed that on the day the shopping season begins, there&#x2019;s typically a big spike in payment transactions. For example, last year, payment transactions nationwide grew by 62.81% on September 30<span style=\"\">th</span>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The &#x201C;Holiday Creep&#x201D; as so many refer to it, annoys some, but not all &#x2013; a recent study saw that 12 percent of millennials (those ages 18 to 29) said they either &quot;like&quot; or &quot;love&quot; all the early holiday marketing/merchandising (<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102115523\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">CNBC</a>). With approximately 25 percent of our customers falling into the millennial age range, we aren&#x2019;t surprised by this trend.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As retailers compete more fiercely each year for holiday shopping dollars, young and savvy shoppers recognize that prices for some gifts are often lowest in September and October &#x2013; not Black Friday (<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443615804578042700772445448\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">WSJ</a>). But the most interesting data actually involves people shopping from their mobile device, a trend that has been growing in recent years. According to our data, Wednesday, October 1, was PayPal&#x2019;s largest mobile shopping day in the US this year, with peak shopping happening during the lunch hour, 11 AM to 1 PM PT.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This year, the total payment volume on mobile (mTPV) spiked on September 30 and October 1, representing a 26.1% and 27.4% increase over the average daily mTPV for 2014. This is up from a 15.4% and 20.4% increase over the average daily mTPV for 2013 over those two days.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So if you&#x2019;re a merchant and you&#x2019;ve missed the start of the shopping season, is all lost? Of course not. You still have plenty of time to stock up for other people&#x2019;s stocking stuffers. The key for most small businesses is to manage the cash flow for your inventory and PayPal can help you out here too. We launched&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/workingcapital/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PayPal Working Capital</a>&#xA0;(PPWC) to help small businesses do exactly that. We will give you a cash advance that you can pay off over time as a percentage of your sales. Since launching PPWC in September 2013, we&#x2019;ve lent $200M to more than 20,000 US small businesses, and in June, we expanded the service to businesses across the UK. Since June (and just in time for the holidays) 48 percent of businesses who are taking advantage of PPWC are using the funds to build inventory to prepare for the busy holiday shopping season.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I joked last year that the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/In-2012-the-Holidays-Ate-Halloween/ba-p/779863\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">holidays have now eaten Halloween</a>. If the last three years of data are any indication, the holidays have fully digested Halloween and are now making a play for Labor Day. And that offers savvy shoppers a great opportunity, whether buying from local or international merchants, in-store, online or on mobile.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We will be back later in the quarter with more PayPal data on this year&#x2019;s Holiday shopping trends. Until then, happy shopping!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Most of the women surveyed described themselves as organized, creative, independent and determined. The other commonality they shared was passion -- with 57% of aspiring entrepreneurs in the US and 43% in China stating it as their business motivation. And the differences that motivate these aspiring entrepreneurs are fascinating as well -- with women in France and Mexico saying they started their businesses because of the pride they would have being a business owner, while women in the US and China were motivated by work-life balance and control of their future.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But for all of the women polled, starting a business on their own was somewhat daunting. Our study found that fears across all regions were tied back to failure and risk, particularly the concern about if their business would make money.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Yet even with these fears, 50 percent of the aspiring entrepreneurs we surveyed were optimistic. They believe that their own abilities will eventually allow them to succeed in the competitive landscape and are committed to giving it their all.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While establishing a successful business requires some planning, our survey surprisingly showed that those who spent the most time (more than a year) thinking about their business actually felt the least prepared. Taking the entrepreneurial plunge requires not only determination, but also the ability to execute &#x2013; and quickly. &#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This survey comes at a time when we here at PayPal have been putting a great deal of thought towards female ambition.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/The-Women-s-Forum-The-Rising-Force-of-Tomorrow-s-Female-Leaders/ba-p/891409\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">At the Women&#x2019;s Global Forum in Deauville, France, last week</a>, I had the opportunity to have a conversation with internationally renowned entrepreneur, Jo Malone. Jo is now on her second international business and has seen her share of challenges, as well as tremendous success. &#xA0;She is really an&#xA0;inspiration.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Jo told me that she believes that entrepreneurs need the freedom to step out and take risks, but just as important is the presence of mind to stand still and assess how far you have come before leaping forward. &#xA0; She also believes it&#x2019;s critical to not lose sight of your vision. Jo pursued her passion and hit multiple challenges along the way, but her resilience enabled her to keep going.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While the world talks about innovation, for her it all starts with the oxygen and energy of inspiration. One needs to be inspired to innovate and should do so with integrity. She says it&#x2019;s important to tell a story, believe everything with honesty and integrity, and if you do so that will ignite the same spark in others around you. &#xA0;I&#xA0;most loved Jo&#x2019;s comment that the first kiss (the first touch point) from&#xA0;a brand is the most&#xA0;precious experience a customer can have.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And even with her international success, she still considers herself to be that small shopkeeper. Jo discussed the half a million small-medium enterprises that started this year in the UK. While a percentage of those will fail, another percentage will go on and employ one more person. The economic opportunity entrepreneurs contribute to is quite powerful. She stressed that it all, &#x201C;starts with that one person that says,&#xA0;<em style=\"\">I will take that risk</em>. The opportunities are immense, if we have the courage to take that step forward.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>I continue to be inspired by the innovation and determination I am seeing from women across the world. It is stories like Jo&#x2019;s that give us the motivation to pursue our creative ideas and take that first step.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

The instant you take a step back and say to yourself, &#x201C;Wow &#x2013; this is really happening!&#x201D; Personally, this moment happens for me most often when I walk into work in the morning. I founded and currently run&#xA0;<a href=\"http://theproscloset.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">The Pro&#x2019;s Closet</a>, the largest used cycling store on eBay. As I enter our 5,000 square feet warehouse in Boulder, CO, buzzing with activity and filled top-to-bottom with cycling parts, I&#x2019;m reminded of the journey that brought me to this point, and the mission that&#x2019;s driven my venture since day one: to foster sustainable business practices for every touch point in the cycling industry, from manufacturer to seller to buyer.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Biking to Business</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Almost a decade ago, I was out of college and racing mountain bikes professionally, living out of my VW van and traveling full time on the race circuit. I sold everything I owned &#x2013; besides the van and the bike &#x2013; to support my racing career. My teammates and I began to amass quite a collection of sponsored equipment. Our on-the-road lifestyle didn&#x2019;t lend itself well to stockpiling extra gear, so I, as the team&#x2019;s resident eBay expert (a self-professed &#x201C;eBay junkie,&#x201D; I&#x2019;d already been using the site for years) began selling items for my teammates.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The whole operation gained momentum organically. Before I knew it, I was behind a computer selling cycling gear more than I was on a bike. I found that my motives had changed; I wanted to grow roots in the business.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Going Global &#x2013; and Staying Green&#xA0;</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>It was always important to me that the business I run be sustainable. In this sense, it was natural to launch The Pro&#x2019;s Closet on eBay because that&#x2019;s where I already bought or sold most of my belongings. Running our shop on eBay not only met my green standards, it was also a smart business decision &#x2013; by selling on a worldwide marketplace platform that guarantees safe and secure payment methods, our small business instantly had global reach.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today, we help anyone in the US sell within and outside the US. The beauty of having access to international customers is that if it&#x2019;s not cycling season in the US, it&#x2019;s peak season somewhere else in the world. With a global online shop, you&#x2019;re open 24-7, 365.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Trade UP &#x2013; An Offline-to-Online Partnership</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At the same time, the bike industry is very brick and mortar retail-centric, and we didn&#x2019;t want to fight that. With more and more people doing their shopping online, we aimed to help the &#x201C;offline&#x201D; part of the bike industry evolve with changing consumer needs and behavior.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This set of circumstances was the inspiration behind our new mom and pop retailer partnership, called &#x201C;Trade UP.&#x201D; In a nutshell, customers trade in their bike at a local shop, the shop gives them a discount on a new bike, and we take the used bike and sell it online. It&#x2019;s a win-win-win: the customers don&apos;t have to deal with the hassle of selling their bike on Craigslist or eBay, the shop can focus their energy on what they do best &#x2013; sell new bikes &#x2013; and we manage the pre-owned side of their business so the bike gets another life and resold to a worldwide market.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Trade Up is a great example of a creative solution that helps make business better for everyone. By partnering with local bike shops, we&#x2019;re enabling them to unlock the value in their old inventory and giving them the capability to sell something that otherwise might not have been sold. And there&#x2019;s no risk of competition &#x2013; our customers are all over the world and the local shops are operating in a completely different marketplace.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Scaling Success</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Trade UP is currently a local operation but we see a big opportunity to grow the effort into other bike-centric communities across the US. We take pride in the fact that we&#x2019;ve never spent a dollar on advertising, but that may change soon and it&#x2019;s not a bad thing &#x2013; it means business is expanding.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our goal is to be the most successful used bike shop in the world, with the customer service of your local mom and pop &#x2013; and given the success of our Trade UP partnerships so far, I like to think we&#x2019;re well on our way.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">September 23, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Scott Ellison, Senior Director Corporate Strategy, PayPal</strong><br><br>Bitcoin has been big news this year, and for good reason. Although crypto-currencies have been around for some time, only Bitcoin has achieved significant scale. This new entrant in the world of payments has people asking lots of questions &#x2013; including how and if PayPal will decide to work with Bitcoin.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While we&#x2019;re focused on giving people everywhere safer and more seamless buying experiences, we&#x2019;re also fierce advocates of giving businesses -- and in turn their customers -- flexibility and the freedom of choice. Earlier this month we announced that businesses working with&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Braintree</a>&#xA0;will soon be able to accept Bitcoin as a payment option through their innovative v.zero SDK and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">relationship with Coinbase</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today we are announcing PayPal&#x2019;s next step in helping merchants accept Bitcoin payments. PayPal has entered into agreements with leading Bitcoin payment processors&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.bitpay.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">BitPay</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.coinbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Coinbase</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.gocoin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">GoCoin</a><span style=\"\">.</span>&#xA0;Starting today, these agreements let PayPal digital goods merchants accept Bitcoin with a simple integration through the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paymentshub\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PayPal Payments Hub</a>. This&#xA0;will be available to merchants in North America first.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We chose to work with BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin because of our commitment to offering innovative and safer ways for businesses to accept payments. All three companies have taken steps to ensure that they know their customers and that those customers are offered certain protections. We believe digital goods merchants will be excited to work with these industry-leading companies to sell ringtones, games and music and get paid with Bitcoin.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>To be clear, today&#x2019;s news does not mean that PayPal has added Bitcoin as a currency in our digital wallet or that Bitcoin payments will be processed on our secure payments platform. PayPal has always embraced innovation, but always in ways that make payments safer and more reliable for our customers. Our approach to Bitcoin is no different. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re proceeding gradually, supporting Bitcoin in some ways today and holding off on other ways until we see how things develop.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But giving our digital goods merchants an easy, one-stop way to test the waters with this new form of payment isn&#x2019;t the only way we work with Bitcoin.&#xA0; For some time now, we&#x2019;ve helped merchants selling Bitcoin mining equipment to accept PayPal payments. This will continue. But to safeguard customers, we&#x2019;ve decided not to work with merchants who pre-sell these products. &#xA0;This is consistent with our approach to pre-sales of other goods; we hold off anytime we determine that pre-selling may not provide a good buyer experience.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Pre-selling is when a business asks for money up-front for a product or service it will deliver in the future. Customers may not get their money back if the business goes out of business before the product is shipped but after a buyer protection period expires.&#xA0; Again, our decision not to support pre-sales is shaped by our desire to protect our customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal also needs to follow the laws and regulations in every market we operate. For this reason, virtual currency exchangers and administrators interested in working with PayPal in the future must secure the appropriate licenses and put anti-money laundering procedures in place.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is excited about all the innovations taking place in payments these days. More choices in how people create value, share it, buy, sell and trade it &#x2013; that&#x2019;s exactly what PayPal is all about. And we believe Bitcoin offers unique opportunities as more people and businesses experiment with it. We are excited to work with businesses and business models that allow us to offer new experiences and the trusted service our customers expect. We hope to do more with Bitcoin as its ecosystem continues to evolve.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

(Nasdaq: EBAY) today said its Board of Directors, following a strategic review of the company&#x2019;s growth strategies and structure, has approved a plan to separate the company&#x2019;s eBay and PayPal businesses into independent publicly traded companies in 2015, subject to customary conditions. Creating two standalone businesses best positions eBay and PayPal to capitalize on their respective growth opportunities in the rapidly changing global commerce and payments landscape, and is the best path for creating sustainable shareholder value, the company said.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;eBay and PayPal are two great businesses with leading global positions in commerce and payments,&#x201D; said eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe. &#x201C;For more than a decade eBay and PayPal have mutually benefited from being part of one company, creating substantial shareholder value. However, a thorough strategic review with our board shows that keeping eBay and PayPal together beyond 2015 clearly becomes less advantageous to each business strategically and competitively. The industry landscape is changing, and each business faces different competitive opportunities and challenges.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;eBay and PayPal will be sharper and stronger, and more focused and competitive as leading, standalone companies in their respective markets,&#x201D; Donahoe continued. &#x201C;As independent companies, eBay and PayPal will enjoy added flexibility to pursue new market and partnership opportunities. And we are confident following a thorough assessment of the relationships between eBay and PayPal that operating agreements can maintain synergies going forward. Our board and management team believe that putting eBay and PayPal on independent paths in 2015 is best for each business and will create additional value for our shareholders.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As the company has previously stated, eBay&#x2019;s board of directors has a practice of regularly reviewing the company&#x2019;s growth strategies and structure, and assessing all alternatives. As part of such assessments, the board regularly explores the following questions: Will separation make eBay and PayPal more competitive? Will separation be possible without distracting innovation and execution? And, will separation create sustainable value for shareholders over time?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In its recently completed review, the board concluded:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">A changing competitive landscape creates enormous opportunities for eBay and PayPal; separation will create sharper strategic focus and better position each business to capitalize on those growth opportunities as independent companies.</strong>&#xA0;The pace of industry change and innovation in commerce and payments requires maximum flexibility to stay competitive and drive global leadership.</li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The benefits of the existing relationships between eBay and PayPal will naturally decline over time and can be optimized in arm&#x2019;s length operating agreements between the two entities.&#xA0;</strong>Arm&#x2019;s length operating agreements can formalize the existing relationships between the two companies and capture ongoing synergies.</li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">This is the best path for delivering sustainable shareholder value.</strong>&#xA0;eBay is a leading global commerce platform that has benefited from PayPal, and PayPal is a strong, rapidly growing global payments leader because it has been part of eBay.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">October 02, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Randi Zuckerberg, CEO, Zuckerberg Media</strong><br><br>Can you even remember back to a time when we had separation between our personal and professional lives online? Before the days of weekend and late night emails from your boss, before your eager new coworker friended you within five minutes on the job, or before someone you met once at a work event felt it was appropriate to ask you to endorse them online or retweet their random charity bike ride? In a world where we know more and more about one another, a world where you can Google someone you&#x2019;re interviewing and immediately get an entire dossier on their lives to date, how can we better navigate the increasingly muddy waters of the web within our work and home lives?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We all know people who take an extreme viewpoint on this. Some people are ok with sharing absolutely everything about their lives online: what they ate for breakfast, their children&#x2019;s potty training misadventures, their wild experiences at Burning Man &#x2013; and they couldn&#x2019;t care less if it&#x2019;s their boss or their grandma seeing it. At the other end of the spectrum, there are people who don&#x2019;t share anything. You won&#x2019;t find them on Twitter or Instagram, they&#x2019;ll tell everyone and anyone who will listen that they aren&#x2019;t on Facebook, as if it&#x2019;s a badge of honor, and a Google search turns up next to nothing.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But most of us fall somewhere in between. And that&#x2019;s where things get complicated.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">7 Professional Connectivity Tips</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Greater connectivity in the workplace provides us with so much opportunity. There&#x2019;s more freedom to work remotely or work more flexible hours. Mobile devices enable a greater percentage of the population to be their own boss and work as freelancers. And having access to endless information at our fingertips allows us to quickly and easily gain new skills and seek out valuable connections and job opportunities. Knowing more about our co-workers means that we feel a deeper connection to them because we&#x2019;ve seen pictures of their children, or know that they also love skiing. However, nothing is ever 100% positive or easy, and with the new opportunity that all this connectivity brings, it also brings some new challenges in how we navigate relationships with our co-workers, and try to maintain a bit of that old-fashioned personal and professional life balance.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to connectivity and our professional lives:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1. Understand that your online reputation is not just what you post about yourself, but also what your friends post about you.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"\">You could be the most rigorous person ever in controlling the image you portray to the world online, but what your friends and strangers say about you&#xA0;</span><em style=\"\">also</em><span style=\"\">&#xA0;shows up online. So make sure to surround yourself with people who truly have your best interest at heart, and stay on top of your search results and online profiles to make sure you&#x2019;re in control of the areas you can be.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. If you have a &#x201C;digital doppelganger&#x201D; (someone with the same name as you) who has unsavory search results, consider your options.</strong><span style=\"\">&#xA0;Like it or not, the first thing someone is going to do before meeting you is search for you online. If you have a common name, or someone with the same name as you who shows up first/poorly in results, consider using a middle initial or a nickname to differentiate yourself, and make sure potential interviewers know that!</span><br><br><strong style=\"\">3. Be authentic, but balanced.</strong><span style=\"\">&#xA0;Nobody wants to be friends with someone whose online profile is totally sterile or who only posts promotional pieces about the company they work for. On the other hand, it&#x2019;s also off-putting to see someone who sits next to you at work, sharing their breast-feeding chart on Instagram (I actually saw this happen!). It&#x2019;s ok to show that you&#x2019;re a human. And it&#x2019;s ok to admit that you&#x2019;re not perfect all the time. But if you took a glimpse at your last 5 posts at any moment in time, they should present a balanced, accurate look at who you are, both professionally and personally.</span><br><br><strong style=\"\">4. Which means&#x2026;we need to cut each other a bit more slack.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"\">I&#x2019;ve definitely had experiences where a co-worker was taking FOREVER getting back to me over email, and then suddenly, I saw them post on Facebook. Wait a minute? They&#x2019;re online, and they have the time to be posting pictures, but they&#x2019;re not responding to me! How rude! I&#x2019;m offended! We have to remind ourselves that we live in a world where we now go online all the time, both for business and for pleasure, and just because someone is online doesn&#x2019;t mean that they are always working. (Unless it is work hours and they work for you, and they should be working. Then that&#x2019;s just poor decision making on their part!)</span><br><br><strong style=\"\">5. It&#x2019;s totally ok to not be friends with your colleagues on every single social network.</strong><span style=\"\">&#xA0;It&#x2019;s perfectly acceptable to tell your colleagues that you keep your social networks limited to close friends and family. Or just leave them pending in &#x201C;friend purgatory&#x201D; until they get the hint on their own. What you don&#x2019;t want to do is accept some co-workers and not others, or have to unfriend people who you work with because you feel uncomfortable with them seeing your posts. Ouch.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><strong style=\"\">6. Set boundaries on your own personal tech/life balance.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"\">Believe it or not, it is ok to not be reachable 100% of the time. Unless you are a doctor on call, the world is not going to end if you step away from your phone for a few minutes. People will treat you how you demand to be treated. Everyone has fire drills once in a while that require working later or longer than normal, but if your boss is making a habit of emailing you late at night and you&#x2019;re making a habit of responding right away, you only have yourself to blame. Setting the precedent of responding right away actually makes it harder to then suddenly set boundaries at a later date. You can train your co-workers that you don&#x2019;t respond to emails late at night. Or that you unplug a bit more on the weekends. Being responsive doesn&#x2019;t mean being on a leash &#x2013; it means responding within a reasonable, acceptable window &#x2013; and often times, waiting a little while helps guarantee that your reply will be more thoughtful. And if you&#x2019;re the one initiating the late night emails for whatever reason (maybe you&#x2019;re a late night person and that&#x2019;s your most productive time), a courteous thing to do is to let people know that you don&#x2019;t expect an immediate response.</span><br><br><strong style=\"\">7. Find a messaging protocol that works for you.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"\">If you have a client who sends you text messages all the time, but you&#x2019;d much prefer if they emailed you, tell them! There are so many ways to reach people these days &#x2013; it&#x2019;s really helpful to let people know how you prefer to be contacted. And it&#x2019;s okay to send people gentle reminders from time to time, such as &#x201C;hey there &#x2013; I know text messages are really fast, but it&#x2019;s hard for me to keep track of our correspondence &#x2013; can you please email me moving forward?&#x201D; If you truly don&#x2019;t want business contacts to call or text you, consider not even putting a phone number on your business cards.</span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Connectivity can be both our best friend and our worst enemy in the workplace. But if you put the same thought and energy into your online presence that you put into your job, you&#x2019;ll find that the blurred lines can actually serve as a tremendous advantage.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\">Randi Zuckerberg runs Zuckerberg Media, a marketing consultancy and production company. She is also the author of two books, &#x201C;Dot Complicated&#x201D; (a New York Times best seller) about managing our complicated online lives, and &#x201C;Dot&#x201D; a children&#x2019;s picture book about finding balance between gadgets and playing outside.

In addition we announced that Braintree has partnered with Coinbase to offer a trusted and secure way for people to pay with bitcoin across their favorite apps in the coming months.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While One Touch&#x2019;s experience and the Braintree partnership with&#xA0;Coinbase are both new, our purpose behind them is something we&#x2019;ve been focused on since the beginning -- it&#x2019;s about offering our customers the most seamless and secure payment experiences, and choice in how, when and where they want to pay.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Bringing seamless experiences with One Touch&#xA0;</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Innovative apps like&#xA0;Jane.com,&#xA0;ParkWhiz,&#xA0;StubHub,&#xA0;Type&#xA0;Tees by Threadless, among others, have already integrated One Touch, the safest way to pay, and will be rolling out the newest&#xA0;version of their apps in the coming days. With One Touch, people can pay across their favorite apps in a single touch, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords each time you pay, while maintaining the trust and security that you expect from PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Eliminating trade-offs: seamless and secure</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Traditionally, there&#x2019;s been a tradeoff between convenience and&#xA0;security, but now we can have both. We tell our mobile devices so much about ourselves that our industry leading fraud tools -- which millions of businesses and consumers trust -- can detect in real time when something seems wrong and can require additional&#xA0;information to complete a purchase. PayPal customers also benefit from extensive seller and buyer protection, giving you the peace of mind when you&apos;re making any transaction with PayPal &#x2013; whether it&apos;s online, via your mobile device or in-store.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Bringing Bitcoin to Braintree developers</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We believe in customer choice -- choice in terms of the device&#xA0;they want to pay on, the OS they prefer to use, and even the payment method they want to pay with. With Braintree&#x2019;s new partnership with Coinbase, merchants and developers that have integrated with Braintree&#x2019;s v.zero SDK will be able to easily begin accepting&#xA0;bitcoin in the coming months, enabling their customers to pay with the alternative currency across their favorite apps.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">For more information on One Touch and Braintree&#x2019;s partnership with Coinbase, visit the&#xA0;</span><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Braintree blog</a><span style=\"\">.&#xA0;</span><strong style=\"\">Hill Ferguson, Chief Product Officer, PayPal</strong><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Dec 10, 2014<br><strong style=\"\">Andy Steingruebl, Director of Ecosystem Security, PayPal</strong><br><br>Last year, we spearheaded an industry collaboration called the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/PayPal-Leads-Industry-Effort-to-Move-Beyond-Passwords/ba-p/782652\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance</a>&#xA0;to help move the industry beyond passwords. More than a year later, we&#x2019;re 150 members strong &#x2013; including companies like Google, Samsung and Microsoft &#x2013; and we&#x2019;ve published the final 1.0 versions of our specifications. The new specifications are available for any company to implement. Most importantly, they make authentication easier and more secure, while also maintaining people&#x2019;s privacy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;ve known for some time now that there is a better way to perform authentication. Passwords have been around for decades, but that technology hasn&#x2019;t kept up with the pace of technology innovation &#x2013; from smartphones to wearables. Today, people want more security with even greater convenience. PayPal&#x2019;s goal with FIDO was to help drive the change to better meet this customer need.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The FIDO specifications come in two flavors: one is password-less (UAF) and the other makes use of a second factor for authentication (U2F). We&#x2019;ve chosen to use the UAF specification since it&#x2019;s easy for our customers to use (often leveraging biometric information), acts as a full password replacement, and increases security and privacy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Earlier this year, we deployed an early version of the FIDO specifications with&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Mobile-World-Congress-Forget-Your-Passwords-Samsung-Galaxy-S5/ba-p/782416\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Samsung</a>&#xA0;so that PayPal customers can shop and pay with their fingerprint at millions of businesses worldwide on the latest Samsung devices.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But, you&#x2019;re probably wondering how this method is more secure while maintaining your privacy. With the FIDO specification, we never store biometric information &#x2013; in our case, the fingerprint &#x2013; in the cloud or on the device. Instead, the fingerprint is converted to a &#x201C;template&#x201D; which never leaves the device. Once you login with your fingerprint, the FIDO key is &#x201C;unlocked&#x201D; to verify your identity. We also perform the authentication over encrypted channels to increase security. Plus, FIDO prevents us from tracking our customers through the protocol as another method for maintaining your privacy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We anticipate even more companies to adopt these specifications, which will help the entire industry dramatically improve beyond passwords. We&#x2019;ll continue our work with the FIDO Alliance as it continues to support a growing community dedicated to the development of secure, easy to use, and privacy respecting ways to authenticate.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

This option is great for folks who might have other commitments during your event but still want to support your cause financially.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Placement is key!</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Make sure to include details on how to donate and that the donation button is easily found on your website (or eblast so people don&#x2019;t have to search for it).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. Be mobile-friendly.</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Make sure your event page and website are optimized for mobile so potential donors are able to chip in painlessly -- no pinching and zooming! (If you&#x2019;re using Eventbrite, you don&#x2019;t need to think about this, all of our event pages are optimized for mobile.)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">4. Think about donation options.</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Quite often people who are really passionate about your cause are willing to go above and beyond. In order to make them feel special and thanked, offer tiered donation levels with different incentives, or offer special VIP upgrades for people who donate a certain amount on top of purchasing a ticket.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">5. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask.</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask for or provide a suggested giving amount. Regardless of the size of your fundraiser, Eventbrite sees an average donation size of over $71.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Join the movement</span></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;re excited to help nonprofits sell more tickets and collect donations, free of Eventbrite service fees, this #GivingTuesday through&#xA0;<a href=\"http://eventbritepages.com/givingtuesday\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Give More Together</a>.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Armed with these tips -- and the ease of donating through PayPal -- we&#x2019;re confident that you&#x2019;ll be able to take your fundraising to the next level this holiday season! &#xA0;Want to learn more about using PayPal for your payment processing with your Eventbrite events?

For example, did you know that people who shop internationally spend nearly twice as much as those who only shop domestically? If you are a merchant looking to attract customers, international shoppers make it worth your while.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Another surprising insight from the study: Austrians are leading the charge globally in cross-border shopping. 83 percent of online Austrian consumers shop internationally, followed by Israel (82 percent) and Australia (75 percent). That means merchants shouldn&#x2019;t just look at the size of a country, but the willingness of the shoppers there to go online and purchase. (By contrast, international shopping is relatively rare in China, where only 26 percent of online shoppers reported making international purchases.)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Around the globe, clothing and footwear are the most sought-after goods for cross-border shoppers, representing 39 percent of their purchases. Consumer electronics is the second most popular category, at 26 percent of all online cross-border purchases.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We also discovered that the most important driver of cross-border shopping isn&#x2019;t the cost of the item or how unique it is, it is the shipping cost. More than half (51 percent) of those who have shopped cross-border in the past 12 months say that delivery costs prevent them from making purchases from another country more often. Similarly, 47 percent of all online shoppers say that free shipping would make them more likely to buy from another country and 51 percent of all adult internet users say that free shipping or postage for returns is a &#x201C;must have.&#x201D; PayPal is already helping merchants meet this demand with free shipping pilots and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/gr/webapps/mpp/refunded-return-shipping?locale.x=en_GR\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">free return shipping</a>programs in 20 markets such as France, Italy and Spain.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Harnessing the Power of Global Trade</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Cross-border trade can be a vital source of incremental revenue for merchants.

Below are three last-minute tips to make the most out of this season&#x2019;s digital shopping frenzy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1. Don&#x2019;t offer discounts to buy, offer discounts to buy MORE</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A time when the masses are expecting to spend a little more than usual is a great opportunity to clear out your inventory. But rather than sell your individual products and services for a special holiday price, offer a discount when customers spend over a set amount (e.g. &#x201C;10% off if you spend over $150&#x201D;) or if customers buy several items all at once (e.g. &#x201C;20% off if you buy more than 5 items&#x201D;).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Not only will you minimize the risk that you give away deals where you don&#x2019;t need to, but you also will assuredly increase the average order size.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Craft very straightforward marketing and sales language on your site</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Very few visitors closely read the words on your webstore. This is especially true during holiday shopping rush. To capture the conversion you seek, make sure to be simple and clear in guiding customers around your site, attracting them to certain areas, and describing the key benefits of your products. Some tactical tips include:<br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Provide gift suggestions so customers can find useful products even if they don&#x2019;t know exactly what they are looking for</li><li style=\"\">Use special fonts sparingly where you want to draw attention</li><li style=\"\">Write one-line bullets emphasizing benefits of each products</li></ul><strong style=\"\">3. Leverage low-cost marketing channels that don&#x2019;t require advance planning</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Social media platforms, offer engines, and email-retargeting campaigns can be fairly quick and relatively low-cost ways to engage new and existing customers. But when we&#x2019;re all suffering from the inevitable information overload that comes with holiday marketing, it takes a little finesse to be heard.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Engage with online shoppers using bite-sized chunks of content in these channels, and don&#x2019;t be afraid to try out less crowded channels. Vine, for example, is perfect for this type of content: short, simple, and best yet, free. Home Depot, a PayPal merchant, has done this recently with&#xA0;<a href=\"https://vine.co/homedepot\" target=\"_self\" style=\"\" title=\"\">fun videos</a>&#xA0;that are&#xA0;engaging, easy to consume, and can be shared on other networking sites.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Start Thinking About Next Year Now</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Use this year&#x2019;s holiday shopping season to take note of what you wish you had done this year, and get the jump on next year right now. If you are looking to get ahead in one particular area, pay special attention to cross-border trade (CBT) as an opportunity area in which to invest early.&#xA0;Already, 50% of online shoppers are currently buying from other countries around the world. If you get on board with cross-border, you can boost sales throughout next year, and especially during next year&#x2019;s holiday season.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While going global might sound a little daunting, PayPal eases the process by offering a guide that&#x2019;ll help you get started (see our 6 step guide to international holiday sales&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-passport.com/\" target=\"_self\" style=\"\" title=\"\">here</a>.

Then they send you to a fake Web site to steal your information.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Tips:</strong>&#xA0;If you get an email from PayPal that you feel may be suspicious, please forward to&#xA0;<a href=\"mailto:spoof@paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">spoof@paypal.com</a>.</em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Use a strong, secure password.&#xA0;</strong>Using the same password at multiple sites is like using the same key for your house, your car, and your office. If something happens to that key, you could be in trouble.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Tip:</strong>&#xA0;In addition to using different passwords for different sites, using an obvious password like &#x201C;password&#x201D; or the name or birthday of a family member is a very common mistake. Instead, use a strong password, which includes a combination of upper and lowercase letters and numbers.</em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. Protect your</strong>&#xA0;<strong style=\"\">device.&#xA0;</strong>Shopping online on an unprotected computer or outdated mobile operating system is like driving without a seat belt.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Tips:</strong>&#xA0;Having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats. Many software and antivirus programs automatically update to defend against known risks. Turn on automatic updates on any device &#x2013; such as laptops, mobile phones and gaming consoles &#x2013; that connects to the Internet if that&#x2019;s an available option.</em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">4. Use an email provider that supports email verification.&#xA0;</strong>Criminals will often send phishing emails trying to trick you into revealing sensitive information. These messages may look legitimate when viewing them, but email verification technology automatically detects when an email is trying to masquerade as if it comes from reputable companies such as PayPal.<br><br><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Tips:</strong>&#xA0;Major webmail providers such as Gmail, Outlook.com, and Yahoo support strong email verification. Using them as your primary email provider significantly decreases the likelihood that you will receive fraudulent email purporting to be from PayPal.</em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">5. Use common sense.</strong>&#xA0;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. A common way to trick someone into following links and doing something risky is to play on fear (e.g. &#x201C;Your account is suspended&#x201D;) and greed (e.g. &#x201C;Claim $100 now&#x201D;).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Tips</strong>: Use common sense when considering what to do online. If you wouldn&#x2019;t do something in the offline world, don&#x2019;t assume its okay online. Trust your instincts.</em><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In case something does go wrong, both PayPal and eBay offer strong seller and buyer protections so you are 100% covered for any unauthorized transactions. Don&#x2019;t ever hesitate to let us know about any suspicious activity on your account. We&#x2019;re here to help keep you protected!<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

No surprise considering last year we found that one in five adults worldwide prefer to shop online in their pajamas. This year, the trend continues as some discounts were offered as early as a week ago before reaching a crescendo today. Global mobile TPV (total payments volume) for&#xA0;Black&#xA0;Friday have seen significant year-over-year increases since 2012, this year&#xA0;mobile TPV increased 56% (as of 12pm PT today) compared to&#xA0;Black&#xA0;Friday 2013.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With numerous devices at the tips of our fingers, it appears people are less willing to venture out into the cold on this shopper&apos;s holiday to get deals for the items on their family&#x2019;s wish-lists&#x2014;instead they want the deals to come to them and technology is making it easier for people to decide how, when and where they choose to shop. Black Friday purchases ramped up as early as Thursday afternoon 1 p.m. &#x2013; 2 p.m. PT/4 p.m. &#x2013; 5 p.m. ET, as some shoppers pulled out their mobile devices even before Thanksgiving dinner, sparing themselves an early morning today.

Need a ride ASAP and don&#x2019;t have any cash? Order and pay for a car through a ride-sharing app. Don&#x2019;t have time to go grocery shopping? Services like Instacart specialize in bringing everything on your shopping list to your doorstep. What if you want to listen to your favorite band&#x2019;s new album in its entirety? The Spotify app can do that.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While these types of technologies and services are brilliant, convenience has become table stakes. So what&#x2019;s next for these brands and others that seek to become game changers in 2015?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>At PayPal, we pride ourselves on being a customer champion company that gives people and businesses simpler and safer ways to move and manage their money with the technology they love to use.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We see a world that works for the people and they are thirsty for the next level of convenience, which we predict will be the &#x201C;seamless experience.&#x201D; According to PayPal&#x2019;s People Economy global&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-media.com/news#time-money-and-tech-paypal-study-reveals\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\">survey</a>, 70 percent of the world thinks technology should make transactions simpler, connected and faster, with more choices and opportunities. The technologies behind these seamless experiences are all beneficial, but more importantly is the impact that this has in bringing all of us closer together.&#xA0; Technology will continue to drop down barriers in the coming year ensuring that all across the globe people are able to achieve their goals and desires in a seamless way.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>This year, I expect to see brands embrace &#x201C;seamlessness&#x201D; in the following three ways:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Device ubiquity</strong>&#xA0;&#x2013; Consumers have thousands of device choices, so brands can no longer expect to get away with only working on a single operating platform or device. While iOS tends to be the predominant operating systems developers start with, Android makes up&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp\" target=\"_self\" style=\"\" title=\"\">84.4%</a>&#xA0;of the global smart phone market share. It&#x2019;s time for brands to start addressing their entire audience and giving everyone access at the time of launch, rather than settling for iOS only.</li></ol><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Deeper integration&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; Global brands will have to create partnerships with other retailers and services to give consumers a completely integrated experience. For example, Etsy works with PayPal and Pinterest to make buying and sharing easier than ever. Every Etsy product listing features a &#x201C;Pin It&#x201D; button and Etsy accepts PayPal from customers all around the world. The more interconnected services can be, the more impactful they will be to consumers.</li></ol><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Global strategy&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; In the same way that consumers now expect to see an app available on all platforms right away, they also want instant access to the product or service from anywhere in the world. Consumers are aware of worldwide news from well-known brands thanks to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and their expectation is that it has global availability. They want to feel included and be valued members of the community. For brands to really engage with consumers they need to cater to their global audience at all times.</li></ol>As a brand, we pride ourselves on continuing to provide seamless offerings to the PayPal community. With our environment changing so rapidly, now is a time to evolve based on the needs and changes in the marketplace and&#xA0; global consumer brands cannot afford to cater to a subset of their market or operate in isolation. I look forward to seeing who emerges in 2015 and leads the way.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Jan 28, 2015<br><strong style=\"\">Tomer Barel, Chief Risk Officer, PayPal</strong><br><br>As the first month of 2015 comes to a close, you may be debating whether or not to continue with your New Year&#x2019;s resolutions. Perhaps you have already decided to stick out your new goal or haven&#x2019;t even made one yet. One resolution worth adding to your list and keeping all year-around is ensuring that your financial information is protected.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, there were 783 reported security and data breaches that took place in 2014, putting more than 82 million consumers and even more businesses at risk. Of those 783 breaches, 43 of them were banking or credit related, compromising the financial information of more than 1.1 million individuals.&#xA0; &#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Although most major corporations, financial institutions and retailers have made payment security their top priority, consumers still need to arm themselves with the most up-to-date payment protection information. This is why PayPal proposes a resolution to protect your financial information year-round.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Here are three tips to leading a lifetime of financial security:<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Embrace the Mobile Wallet.&#xA0;</strong>Not only does the mobile wallet allow you to lighten your pockets when you leave home, it also gives you peace of mind when making transactions. PayPal offers one of the safest, leading global digital wallets to its consumers, where all transactions are monitored around the clock and protected by next-level encryption. And because PayPal is device agnostic, it can be used with Android, Blackberry and iPhone devices, making it easy for anyone, almost anywhere, to securely make payments using their mobile phones.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Protect Your Devices with a Password.&#xA0;</strong>With the number of mobile transactions increasing, so should the security we use to protect the financial information stored on our smart devices. And while mobile wallets offer higher security, we are still vulnerable to theft or loss of mobile devices. The easiest solution in protecting your phone and its precious content&#xA0;is to create a passcode that locks anyone out who doesn&#x2019;t know it. All the leading smartphones contain this passcode feature &#x2013; some even have fingerprint ID technology &#x2013;&#xA0;and it takes less than 5 minutes to set up.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Opt for Safer Payment Methods.&#xA0;</strong>When making an online purchase, people often worry about the risks of sharing their credit card information and forget that there are other payment options. PayPal is a secure alternative to paying online or in-store with credit or debit cards. The service is offered as a payment option at millions of popular websites.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Finally, it&#x2019;s always important to make sure the website you&#x2019;re shopping on is secure. An easy way to check the security of the site is to take a look at the website&#x2019;s URL. URLs always start with a Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. An &#x201C;S&#x201D; at the end&#x2014;&#x201C;HTTPS&#x201D;&#x2014;stands for &#x201C;secure,&#x201D; and indicates that the website has an extra layer of security capabilities, allowing for the secure communication of payment information. You can also find a padlock icon in front of the URL to indicate the website is secure.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While this may seem like a lot to consider when just trying to make a simple purchase, it&#x2019;s important to remember that the security of your financial information is worth it. In the spirit of the New Year, and the Lunar New Year beginning February 19th, now is a better time than any to embrace these changes and continuously take the steps to lead a long, more secure, tech-savvy life.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br></div>\n\n\t\t",

Combining dual incomes, loans and investments may seem daunting, but it&#x2019;s a necessary first step in creating financial coherence. The key to any successful relationship is communication, but that&#x2019;s also the secret to financial success. Sit down with your partner to openly discuss goals, savings strategies and future purchase aspirations so that you can meet financial realities head on. If the goal is to have a big wedding and purchase a home in five years, or take the trip you&#x2019;ve been dreaming about, a thoughtful financial plan will make it much more obtainable.

Lucky for them, by using the ParkMobile app, PayPal enables users to pay the parking meter with their smartphones, reducing the need for spare change.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Friends and Funds<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Americans&apos; payment frustrations aren&apos;t limited to wallets. 54 percent of Americans reported that they have been &quot;stiffed&quot; by someone, either intentionally or unintentionally. Victims report this happening most often for a meal. Since PayPal enables person to person transfers, users are able to request that money immediately, helping to reduce the chance they wouldn&apos;t get paid (and the likelihood they have to awkwardly hassle a friend for payment).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While each country reported being most often stiffed on a meal, friends purchasing coffee and alcoholic beverages were also likely to not be paid back.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>-- Australians are most likely to get stiffed - nearly 6 in 10 (57%) reports being stiffed; Brits are least likely to get stiffed - but most likely to be stiffed for a pint;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>-- In Germany and Australia, men are significantly more likely than women to report that they&apos;ve been stiffed (german:57% men vs. 51% women)(australia:60% men vs. 54% women);<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>-- Beware of the young - those under 25 are significantly more likely than any other age group to stiff their peers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Change for Spare Change<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The wallet&apos;s demise may be preceded only by the extinction of the penny. Earlier this year, Canada ceased distribution of its penny, joining Australia, New Zealand and other countries that have dropped 1-cent coins because of rising metal costs and a diminishing need.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the U.S., a penny already costs more than 2c to produce, but Americans report their spare change usually isn&apos;t used. Nearly 7 in 10 Americans (66%) report they usually put their spare change in a jar and nearly 10 percent just give it to their kids. PayPal and Coinstar are already working together to help consumers easily convert that spare change into a PayPal balance at select Coinstar kiosks nationwide.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>-- Americans and Brits are most likely to lose their spare change; Germans are least likely to lose change;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>-- Germans are most likely to carry change with them - nearly three times more likely than Americans and nearly twice as likely as Brits.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Solving Payment Pain Points<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&quot;It&apos;s not about replacing cash or your credit card with a new payment method, it&apos;s about using technology to solve real shopping pain points,&quot; said David Marcus, PayPal President. &quot;PayPal is at the forefront of developing products that make life easier, help shoppers be more efficient, and untether consumers from their wallets forever.&quot;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Through features like Check In and Order Ahead, the company already provides its 128 million customers simpler payment experiences. With the PayPal app, users can use the Check-In feature to pay with just a few clicks and a picture of their face rather than a wallet. Consumers can also &quot;order ahead&quot; in select locations in the United States with the PayPal app, allowing them to pre-order and have their item waiting for them -- already paid for.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>About the Survey<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The PayPal Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com) among 1,000 credit and debit card holders, ages 18 and older, in each of the following countries: U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, and Australia between April 26th and May 13th, 2013, using an email invitation and an online survey.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points, in all of the countries, from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>About PayPal<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is the faster, safer way to pay and get paid online.

It will reinvent today&#x2019;s in-store shopping experience by making it simpler, faster and richer for consumers, while providing retailers with more ways to differentiate themselves from their competitors.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;PayPal Beacon opens the door to a fundamentally different way to use technology to make shopping more valuable and more personal for consumers and retailers&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;PayPal Beacon opens the door to a fundamentally different way to use technology to make shopping more valuable and more personal for consumers and retailers,&#x201D; said David Marcus, president, PayPal. &#x201C;We challenged ourselves to find a better experience than swiping a credit card. We figured the only better way to pay would be to do nothing. Just walk in a store, and, like magic, when you&#x2019;re ready to pay, money is transferred securely. No wallet. No card. Nothing to do. Not even touching your phone.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Faster than swiping a credit card or tapping a mobile phone at the point of sale, PayPal Beacon will make the payment experience get out of the way. It will leverage Bluetooth Low Energy; a breakthrough technology that enables connected devices to communicate with each other seamlessly, while keeping the energy consumption at a very low level. By using BLE, transactions can take place without having to open up an app, without GPS being turned on, and even without a phone signal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Consumers will have full control of stores they will want to check in to, those they will want to get prompted to confirm payment for, and stores they will want to enable a complete hands-free experience for. We value our customers&#x2019; privacy, so PayPal Beacon won&#x2019;t constantly track a user&#x2019;s location. If a consumer enters a store and declines to check in, or just ignores the prompt entirely, no information is transmitted to PayPal or the merchant.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For retailers, PayPal Beacon means they don&#x2019;t have to incentivize consumers to download another app. They can provide more unique, branded shopping experiences to millions of consumers through the PayPal app. Any store running point of sale systems compatible with PayPal, including Booker, Erply, Leaf, Leapset, Micros, NCR, PayPal Here, Revel, ShopKeep, TouchBistro and Vend, and many more soon, will simply plug a PayPal Beacon device in a power outlet in their store. Once the Beacon is plugged in, they will be ready to offer the best, most personal shopping experience ever.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We will be opening up our mobile in-store API soon for 100 developers to imagine ways to make the shopping experience better, from being able to self-checkout on your mobile phone to automatically placing a customer&#x2019;s usual order as soon as they walk through the door.

Big numbers, but how do retailers prepare for these fast-approaching and sometimes challenging industry payment trends?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is making payments simpler than ever, delivering more value to retailers and driving significant revenue to their bottom lines. We are helping retailers drive sales by increasing Average Order Value (AOV) with the launch of a new PayPal Credit offering and also announcing consulting services that help expand product or international expansion. Our global reach into 203 markets allows PayPal to collaborate with merchants and industry partners to create better and secure experiences for people online, in-store and on mobile devices.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">A Clear and Simple Credit Option&#xA0;</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal continues to move credit more towards the center of our brand. PayPal Credit and the ability to pay in monthly payments is another example of how we are working hard to bring value to merchants and create better credit offerings that are simple, transparent and affordable and help meet the demand for consumer credit. For the first time, by leveraging new credit models retailers can customize PayPal Credit to offer a monthly payment option and decide on the number of months and interest rate that works best for their customers. They can also offer interest free options to customers shopping online who are approved in minutes.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The new PayPal Credit feature works within the open-ended construct of the PayPal Credit product, allowing customers to divide their larger purchases into substantially equal monthly payments.&#xA0;This gives consumers more control and helps them to better manage their budget. We learned through the launch of PayPal Working Capital that people appreciate knowing the full amount that they are being charged in advance. Providing customers with clear and flexible credit terms helps retailers to drive sales by increasing AOV and reducing shopping cart abandonment. And, businesses know their customers best, so it makes sense that they should have the freedom to choose which credit options they want to offer. Merchants are paid immediately and PayPal settles with the consumer.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Enhancing Value Through Our Expertise: PayPal Business Consulting</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is more than just a button on a website that enables people to pay for items or services. We have deep expertise working with retailers around the world and access to a wealth of data that can help a business make better and smarter decisions. PayPal&#x2019;s Business Consulting offers expertise to help PayPal merchants add value, understand the business landscape and provide customer-focused services to help drive growth.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Business Consulting services are provided in a &#x201C;customer-centric&#x201D; way&#x2014;our primary goal is to give our business partners the best shot at long-term success and growth from pre-engagement through post-launch. By helping merchants leverage best practices (e.g., reducing cart abandonment, improving conversion, making sales internationally) and offering custom engineered products&#x2014; we eliminate friction and jumpstart sales. For several years, the team has been available to select PayPal merchants, directly resulting in millions of dollars of incremental revenue. For example, last year the Optimization team&#x2014;just one slice of the larger team&#x2014;created millions of dollars for hundreds of SMBs and large businesses. See a demonstration of PayPal integration for merchants here:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://demo.paypal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">http://demo.paypal.com</a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">PayPal DNA</strong><br><br><span style=\"\"></span>Solving problems in payments is in our core DNA. Retailers want to offer flexible credit so people can buy more, but also still get paid. Retailers want to uncover areas of growth and our consultants can help. We are making shopping easier and allowing retailers to connect with their customers in compelling ways to get paid. In the coming days, we will demonstrate even further the value PayPal brings to retailers through new customers, our partners, and new products and functionality.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Today, we spotlight the value of collaboration, unveiling a new PayPal Here reader that will also include payment support for Microsoft Surface and other Windows devices through our efforts with Microsoft. Small businesses that use the PayPal Here reader, Windows 8.1 app, and SDK on these devices will benefit from the same world-class product features and customer support enjoyed by existing PayPal Here users. Later this year, we&#x2019;re bringing an EMV-compliant PayPal Here reader to the US, a technology that small businesses throughout the UK and Australia have already been using with great success. In short, PayPal Here continually evolves with new and innovative functionality to help small businesses serve their customers and increase sales. Additional advantages of this solution for small businesses are outlined on the Microsoft Surface&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.surface.com/2015/01/surface-and-paypal-for-small-business/\" target=\"_self\" style=\"\" title=\"\">blog</a>&#xA0;today.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Value of Collaboration: PayPal Here for Windows</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">PayPal loves collaborating with other smart technology leaders to put new products and features into the hands of retailers. With help from Microsoft, select small businesses can now accept credit card, debit card, and PayPal transactions using the Windows platform&#x2014;via the PayPal Here SDK and, very soon, the PayPal Here app. PayPal Here compatibility will become available for the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-pro-3\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">Surface Pro 3 tablet</span></a></span><span style=\"\">,&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">the Lumia&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phone/lumia830/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">830</span></a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phone/lumia635/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">635</span></a>smartphones,&#xA0;</span><span style=\"\">and other devices that</span><span style=\"\">&#xA0;operate on Windows 8.1.

We&#x2019;re pleased to share the availability of this technology will expand to small businesses in the U.S. later this year, with support for iOS, Android, and Windows. An updated PayPal Here reader is being developed to support EMV and contactless transactions for small businesses that connect to mobile devices via Bluetooth, enabling them to accept any chip card, magnetic stripe card, or contactless payment form, including mobile wallets.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Customized Payment Apps</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">The PayPal Here SDK that we previously&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Announcing-the-PayPal-Here-SDK-Helping-Businesses-Get-Payments/ba-p/870231\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><span style=\"\">announced as a pilot</span></a>&#xA0;for iOS and Android devices will officially launch later this month, allowing developers to easily integrate PayPal Here payment functionality into the custom apps they build for small businesses. With this flexibility, small business owners can enjoy the full range of innovative PayPal checkout benefits - including the ability to take credit card, debit card, and other forms of payment on the go, manage CRM and inventory, create and maintain invoices, and more - in a way that addresses the specific needs of their unique business. And, whether a small business is leveraging a third-party-created app with the PPH SDK for iOS, Android, or now via our Windows pilot, all transactions will be processed using the same high security standards as the PayPal Here app, giving small businesses peace of mind that they are receiving best-in-class fraud protection.</span><br><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Adding Value to Businesses of All Sizes</strong></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">While 2015 has just begun, the opportunities for small businesses this year already seem boundless.

While Paydiant may not be a name you recognize, if you like to pay with mobile apps, you are likely to be very familiar with the technology they&apos;ve built. They&apos;re the folks that have helped companies like Subway, Harris Teeter, Capital One and many others build mobile payments, offers and loyalty into their own mobile applications. They also provide the mobile wallet platform for MCX whose members include many of the world&apos;s largest retailers including Walmart, Target, Sears, Wendy&apos;s, Exxon, CVS and many others.<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>With the addition of Paydiant, PayPal becomes an even stronger business partner for merchants. Using Paydiant&#x2019;s platform, our merchant partners can now create their own branded wallets to accelerate mobile-in-store payments and drive consumer engagement through mobile payments, loyalty, offers and the prioritization of preferred payment types, such as store branded credit cards and gift cards. Similar to PayPal, Paydiant&#x2019;s technology agnostic approach means that merchants can use any mobile payment technology &#x2013; QR codes or NFC &#x2013; that best suits their business. Along with acquiring incredible technology, we also get Paydiant&#x2019;s team of brilliant mobile developers, strong business leaders and visionary founders&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.paydiant.com/about/leadership.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">Kevin Laracey and Chris Gardner</u></a>.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>By joining the PayPal family, Paydiant will be able to scale its mobile wallet technology and offer value-added benefits to its merchant customers that only a combined PayPal and Paydiant can provide &#x2013; world-class risk management, 24 x 7 customer support, loyalty points and private label card acceptance, an open payments platform that supports all mobile operating systems, and global reach into more than 200 markets and 162 million active digital wallets.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the receipt and timing of regulatory approval for the transaction, the possibility that the transaction may not close, the reaction to the transaction of Paydiant&#x2019;s customers and partners, PayPal&#x2019;s plans for Paydiant, the future growth of Paydiant&#x2019;s and PayPal&#x2019;s businesses, the reaction of competitors to the transaction and the possibility that integration following the transaction may be more difficult than expected.

While most people today understand the value of shopping online wherever and whenever they want, there&#x2019;s still a surprisingly high percentage of people that rarely make Internet purchases or still prefer the in-store experience.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>According to a 2012&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/03/uk-internet-usage-idUSLNE83201U20120403\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">Ipsos</u></a>&#xA0;report, only half of the world&#x2019;s population had shopped online.

When it comes to buying online, you want to trust who&#x2019;s handling your money and know that it&#x2019;s safer and secure.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Around the world, markets such as Russia have such little trust in online shopping that they prefer to pay on delivery with cash. We understand the desire to get goods before having to pay &#x2013; there&#x2019;s a level of satisfaction once you know you&#x2019;re really getting what you set out to buy. That&#x2019;s why we provide our&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/pad-get-pay\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">Pay After Delivery</u></a>service so users can buy online and pay for their goods 14 days later - or sooner if preferred. PayPal then sends an alert before deducting money from their bank account.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Convenience.</strong>&#xA0;Face it, when you want something, you want it right away. If your online shopping experience isn&#x2019;t more convenient than going to the store and buying on the spot, you aren&#x2019;t going to do it. However,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Together-PayPal-and-Ipsos-Unveil-Top-Growth-Areas-for-Global/ba-p/908613\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">a recent 2014 survey</u></a>&#xA0;PayPal commissioned with Ipsos found that 43 percent of online shoppers do so for convenience &#x2013; particularly because it saves them time and money. Another specific element that people love about online shopping is the option of fast or free shipping.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Returns.</strong>&#xA0;You don&#x2019;t want to deal with the hassle of returning products you buy online. Additionally, you don&#x2019;t want to pay more for something than you would in-store, so paying for return shipping is a deal-breaker for many people. According to a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2014/6/Study-Consumers-Demand-More-Flexibility-When-Shopping-Online\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">comScore report</u></a>, people now expect free returns. In fact, 82 percent of respondents stated they would complete a purchase if they could return the item to in store or have free return shipping. That&#x2019;s why PayPal offers return shipping at no cost in 22 markets around the globe.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Online shopping doesn&#x2019;t have to be scary. It can actually make your life easier &#x2013; and allow you to shop from all around the world. With options from Pay After Delivery to free two-day shipping to return shipping at no cost, we give the trust and security that has been missing from online shopping.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Since founding&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.sanskritii.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">Sanskritii</u></a>&#xA0;in 2011, the interest coming from foreign countries (which accounts for 95 percent of her sales) has allowed her to build a staff of 15 and sell over 100 items a day to people as far away as Russia, the United States and Australia.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Leveraging unique, local goods for international sales is a great way to expand an existing business or kickoff a new venture.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Take Advantage of the Flexibility E-commerce Provides</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Many aspiring merchants dream of opening their own little shop one day to sell their wares &#x2013; but maintaining a physical store isn&#x2019;t always the best option for their business or their family.

After welcoming their first child, the Stephensons made the decision to become an online-only business to enhance their work-life balance.

The ATM scrapped the need to scramble to the bank to get cash. Debit cards created a whole new way for consumers to shop and for merchants to charge, creating opportunities at points of sale, and later, online.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Now, the increasing use of mobile technology &#x2013; driven largely by millennials &#x2013; is set to make an even bigger impact on the ways we manage and move money. Over the next five years, new mobile payment technologies will reshape money more than the ATM, debit cards and all other banking innovations had in the past 50 combined.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Innovation has made it possible to rent movies, book trips and download novels with the touch of a screen. We&apos;re at that critical point with money; it&apos;s time to unlock the same benefits of choice, access and flexibility of cash, and that&apos;s why I jumped at the chance to join PayPal as president and CEO.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal handles almost 12 million payments for our customers every day&#xA0;&#x2013; more than a quarter of these payments are made on mobile devices. Overall, mobile commerce is growing at nearly three times the rate of e-commerce.&#xA0;That&apos;s an astounding figure.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>But the increasing digitization of money isn&#x2019;t just a technology story. It&#x2019;s about human impact, providing financial freedom, flexibility and opportunity to millions of people worldwide.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We see opportunity among consumers, who are moving away from a wallet full of plastic, and tell us they want better ways to manage their money. These customers want simpler and secure digital payment options. We see other consumers who are poorly served by existing financial institutions, and we feel technology can make their lives easier and less expensive.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Businesses, meanwhile, are seeking ways to thrive. And with exposure to markets all over the world, they need more support than ever to get that jump-start into the global economy or even into new markets. We&#x2019;re expanding innovations such as PayPal Working Capital, giving merchants access to funds without a credit check. Repayment is based on sales, not monthly billing terms. Gone are the days of waiting weeks or months to get verified for that loan to expand your dream business.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Companies also are increasingly apprehensive about fraud and security fears that lurk within digital finance. We&#x2019;re addressing these concerns; recently we agreed to acquire the mobile wallet provider Paydiant, enhancing our in-store payment capabilities and allowing us to create engaging, convenient and secure ways for people to shop at the brands consumers love.&#xA0;As the lines between online and offline blur, we understand that trusted, secure payments allow us to create deeper, loyal relationships between businesses and their customers.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Record of innovation</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>On one hand, the move to mobile money isn&#x2019;t entirely new. More than 15 years ago, PayPal captured the potential to transform money for people and businesses around the world through mobile technology. PayPal&#x2019;s very first payment was made via Palm Pilot, a pioneer among mobile devices. But the world has changed and continues to do so swiftly.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;re focused on meeting the changing needs of customers &#x2013; driven by millennials. This group makes up a quarter of the population and accounts for roughly a fifth of consumer spending in America. These 18- to 34-year-olds demand fast and simple ways to manage their financial life in the safest possible manner. And they are mobile. That&#x2019;s 80 million total potential users who speak the language of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://venmo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">Venmo</u></a>, our mobile payments service that accounted for $2.4 billion in payment volume in 2014.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Being at the cusp of change is amazingly exciting. But for the thousands of people that work at PayPal it&#x2019;s more than that. We truly believe - because we see it every day - when you transform money you empower the potential of people around the world. You make it easier for people to do the things they want to do with their money. Running a small business becomes safer and simpler. Taking a great new idea from inspiration to monetization becomes faster, because you make it possible for funds to get from the people who want to back the idea to those who need support.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Later this year, PayPal will become a separate company from eBay Inc. This will afford us the opportunity to focus entirely on our customers&apos; needs and build on our foundation&#xA0;so we can further extend our lead in this exciting space.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>If we do this right, our team will have the once in a lifetime opportunity to transform money to power the potential of our customers around the world.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

New research from PayPal and Ipsos* shows that cross-border trade is a driving force of the global marketplace, with cross-border shoppers (those for whom more than 10 percent of their online spend is cross-border), spending approximately twice as much as consumers who only shop domestically. The research, which investigated the online and cross-border shopping habits of more than 17,500 consumers in 22 countries, also reveals opportunities and best practices for merchants who wish to grow their international business this December and beyond.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;By identifying trade opportunities around the world, our research findings can help merchants tap into the expanding global marketplace,&#x201D; said Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiatives for PayPal.&#x201D; In addition to research, we are also actively providing our merchants with tools such as&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.paypal.com/passport\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PayPal PassPort</a>&#xA0;and selling opportunities such as our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.paypal-wujinggou.com/\" style=\"\" title=\"\">China Singles Day</a>&#xA0;program, to help them attract more business overseas.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Who Is Buying Cross-Border?&#xA0;</strong><br>Cross-border shopping is most prominent in Austria, where 83 percent of online consumers shop internationally, Israel (82 percent) and Australia (75 percent). Conversely, international shopping is relatively rare in China, where only 26 percent of online shoppers reported making international purchases, the United States (30 percent), and Poland (35 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>However, China may soon become a bigger market for international trade. Fifty-two percent of Chinese online consumers said they plan to begin shopping cross-border or increase their cross-border shopping in the next 12 months, giving China the 3rd largest projected growth, behind Mexico (59 percent) and Russia (54 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">What Shoppers Want and Where They Want it From</strong><br>Clothing and footwear are the most sought-after goods for cross-border shoppers, representing 39 percent of online cross-border purchases. Additionally, it is consistently the dominant category across every individual region: North America (33 percent), Latin America (47 percent), Middle East (47 percent), Western Europe (33 percent), Nordics (36 percent), Central and Eastern Europe (50 percent) and Asia Pacific (43 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>There are wide regional variances regarding preferences beyond clothing and footwear. Overall, consumer electronics is the second most popular category, at 26 percent of all online cross-border purchases. However, it does not rank second in all regions. In Asia Pacific it ranks third, behind cosmetics and beauty products, in the Nordics it ranks fourth, behind physical entertainment (e.g. books, DVDs) and travel &amp; transportation; and in North America, it ranks a distant fifth.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As for country of origin, U.S. and Chinese goods are the most popular overall, representing 26 and 18 percent of all online cross-border purchases, respectively. However, regional preferences vary. North America, Latin America, the Nordics and the Middle East all prefer American goods, while Western European cross-border shopping is dominated by German merchandise, and Central and Eastern European consumers most often purchase from China.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Free Shipping is the Key to Consumers&#x2019; Hearts</strong><br>Shipping cost is of paramount importance to cross-border shoppers. More than half (51 percent) of those who have shopped cross-borders in the past 12 months say that delivery costs prevent them from making purchases from another country more often. Similarly, 47 percent of all online shoppers say that free shipping would make them more likely to buy from another country and 51 percent of all adult internet users say that free shipping or postage for returns is a &#x201C;must have.&#x201D; PayPal is already helping merchants meet this demand with free shipping pilots and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/gr/webapps/mpp/refunded-return-shipping?locale.x=en_GR\" style=\"\" title=\"\">free return shipping</a>&#xA0;in 20 markets such as France, Italy and Spain.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Putting this Information into Practice</strong><br>In addition to these global findings, specific data is available for all 22 countries included in the research.

PayPal&#x2019;s flexible technology, open ecosystem and global reach into 203 markets allows us to not only scale and deploy quickly, but also deliver seamless and secure customer experiences that help save people time and money. By being a strategic partner to merchants, we can help them grow their business and reach more customers.

You tap your card or mobile device on the screen of the reader until the LEDs show at the top of the card reader.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With PayPal Here, there&#x2019;s just a one-off charge for the reader (pricing to be shared at launch) and a small fee for each transaction*.

We don&apos;t believe there&#x2019;s a silver bullet when it comes to security, and we know we can&#x2019;t just build a big wall to stop people from getting in. We are a firm believer that open industry collaboration is important to help protect consumers wherever they shop and pay. Progress on tools like tokenization and new authentication methods are promising, but those efforts must be combined with risk analytics and management to help prevent, detect and respond to threats to our customers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We want to share our point of view on technologies that are crucial to raising the bar for a more secure payments approach. These technologies are part of the White House initiatives around cybersecurity and consumer protection, and will be further discussed at the Summit.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Supporting an Open, Collaborative Approach to Tokenization&#xA0;</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Today, we&#x2019;re pleased to announce PayPal&apos;s commitment to an open,&#xA0;collaborative&#xA0;approach to tokenization.&#xA0;PayPal has been doing tokenization for more than 15 years by securely storing customers&#x2019; financial information in the cloud, and never sharing that information with merchants.&#xA0;As proof of our commitment to support the worldwide interoperability standards being established around tokenization&#xA0;we recently joined EMVCo, the global body that manages specifications and testing processes for payment card standards, as a business and technical associate.&#xA0;We will&#xA0;partner with companies across the payments industry to&#xA0;further&#xA0;develop an open, interoperable tokenization platform so that merchants can&#xA0;leverage&#xA0;tokenization capabilities across any technology and device, and make the experience seamless for the consumer. As the most trusted brand in digital payments, it is our&#xA0;responsibility&#xA0;to foster and lead&#xA0;industry collaboration that results in a true open&#xA0;tokenization solution that&#xA0;allows&#xA0;all&#xA0;payment methods (e.g.,&#xA0;Private Label Credit Cards and loyalty points), and powers any innovative commerce experience.&#xA0;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Leading the Industry Effort to Move Beyond Passwords</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>It&#x2019;s no surprise that people reuse the same password for everything, simply because people struggle to make new, unique passwords each time. PayPal is finding new ways for people to authenticate &#x2013; conveniently and securely on their mobile devices. As a founding member of the FIDO Alliance, we strongly believe that industry collaboration is required to create a future where a password is no longer needed. From our&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-pages.com/samsunggalaxys5/us/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">fingerprint authentication technology with Samsung</u></a>&#xA0;to launching&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Braintree-Brings-One-Touch-Payments-to-the-People-and-Will-Offer/ba-p/872921\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\" title=\"\"><u style=\"\">One Touch payments</u></a>, we&#x2019;re helping the consumers authenticate in more secure and convenient ways.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Making Risk Management the Heart of our Security Strategy</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Protecting our customers is our top priority. While tokenization and authentication are important pieces of the puzzle, PayPal works behind the scenes to go beyond just protecting customer credentials. A person&#x2019;s data is, unfortunately, exposed in so many different ways &#x2013; making it hard to think your information is always &#x201C;protected&#x201D;. According to Symantec, more than 552 million identities were exposed in 2013. We&#x2019;ve continued to make it a priority to have risk management at the heart of our strategies. Combining advanced data processing with human oversight is how we keep your money moving to the right people and out of the hands of the wrong ones. Our system gets smarter with every transaction we process, allowing us to accurately establish patterns in order to trust good people, and spot the bad guys.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our philosophy is, and has always been, to make sure we look at security and consumer protection together. This means, we protect customers&#x2019; personal information and their PayPal accounts; and when we collect information it&#x2019;s for the sole purpose of verifying your identity and protecting you from fraud.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>We&#x2019;re committed to supporting the White House&#x2019;s efforts to increasing public-private partnerships and cybersecurity information sharing, improving cybersecurity practices and technologies, and most importantly, improving the adoption and use of more secure payment technologies.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

Our goal is to extend our global security leadership, and bolster our efforts in predictive threat detection and prevention.

Today, we&#x2019;re unveiling a new research report that is focused on the habits of mobile shoppers or &#x201C;mobile movers&#x201D;. In examining the online and cross-border shopping habits of 17,600 consumers in 22 countries, one thing is evident: mobile shopping is on target for meteoric growth. Mobile commerce (or m-commerce) is growing at three times the rate of e-commerce. Between 2013 and 2016, the compound annual growth rate for m-commerce is projected at 42 percent vs. 13 percent for e-commerce.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is committed to helping merchants of all sizes achieve success. While mobile shopping is still relatively nascent (around 33% of online shoppers currently shop via smartphone), it is clear that m-commerce is on the cusp of a major breakthrough. As mobile increases its global shopping footprint with ease and convenience, it&#x2019;s crucial for small businesses to adapt their strategies to find new buyers and increase sales.

In China, they account for 86% and in Mexico, 88%! This fast-growing group of consumers are increasingly using their phones for every part of their lives. Utilizing this knowledge to get their attention now will reap rewards for savvy international sellers for years to come.

        "title": "PayPal’s Latest Leap in Protecting Customers from Fake Email",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Feb 18, 2015<br><strong style=\"\">J. Trent Adams, Sr. Internet Security Advisor, PayPal</strong><br><br><br>PayPal doesn&#x2019;t shy away from big ideas. Having been built on a&#xA0;revolutionary idea to easily move money between customers, it&#x2019;s in our lifeblood to innovate. But that innovation doesn&#x2019;t exist only within our own products. We also focus on big ideas that help protect our customers beyond our borders.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Just a few years ago many customers were bombarded with fraudulent email intent on stealing information to break into their accounts. Now, there&#x2019;s been a sea change in phishing attack patterns as we&#x2019;re helping mailbox providers shut down key attack vectors. As a result, mailbox providers are blocking more than 15 million fraudulent email messages attacking our customers each month. Each message that was blocked from being received by a customer is one less potential victim. To understand how we&#x2019;ve been able to make this impact on phishing, let&#x2019;s rewind the clock six years.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Back in 2009 PayPal had another big idea. It started when looking for a solution to a particularly vexing problem: how to combat fraudulent email targeting our customers. Once we&#x2019;d uncovered a possible solution we realized we couldn&#x2019;t realize it&#x2019;s full potential on our own. So, we formed a consortium of collaborators, including industry heavyweights like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo, to work together on the solution. Then three years ago we released the Domain-based Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance technical specification. Known as&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.dmarc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">DMARC</u></a>, the solution locks the door against a specific type of fraudulent email known as domain spoofing.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For more background about our work on DMARC, check out some of our previous posts on the topic:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/One-Year-Later-and-Email-Protection-Continues-to-Improve-with/ba-p/781688\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">One Year Later and Email Protection Continues to Improve with DMARC</u></a></li><li style=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/PayPal-eBay-and-FTC-Partner-to-Help-People-Sell-Safely-Online/ba-p/908707\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">PayPal, eBay and FTC Partner to Help People Sell Safely Online</u></a></li><li style=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/An-Increase-in-Phishing-Attempts-Isn-t-Bad-if-They-Don-t-Succeed/ba-p/871123\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">An Increase in Phishing Attempts Isn&#x2019;t Bad if They Don&#x2019;t Succeed</u></a></li></ul>On Wednesday, February 18, 2015, the original consortium&#xA0;<a href=\"http://dmarc.org/press/release-20150218/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">published updated information about the utility and accelerating adoption of DMARC</u></a>. Given the proven value it provides, it&#x2019;s not surprising that major mailbox providers such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have seen significant increases in senders adopting DMARC. What started as a handful of highly phished brands protecting their email with DMARC has grown 50% in the past year alone. And if you check the Alexa Top 10 most visited domains, 80% of them publish DMARC records.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Joining the likes of Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, 7 out of the top 10 major US financial institutions also protect their customers with DMARC. Internationally, the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240231320/Lets-reclaim-email-says-HMRC-cyber-security-head\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">HM Revenue &amp; Customs department in the UK</u></a>&#xA0;and the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/_downloads/techniker/netzwerk/BSI-CS-098.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">German Office for Information Security (BSI)</u></a>&#xA0;have also requested that their respective government agencies support DMARC.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>And now Kaspersky Lab published their &#x201C;<a href=\"http://25zbkz3k00wn2tp5092n6di7b5k.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/02/KSN_Financial_Threats_Report_2014_eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\"><u style=\"\">Financial Cybersecurity 2014</u></a>&#x201D; report that includes further evidence that DMARC is working to protect our customers. They report that they detected a significant reduction in the number of phishing email attacks against PayPal last quarter. Specifically, they report that when comparing attacks against financial services companies, the percentage of attacks against PayPal &#x201C;decreased by 14.09 percentage points: from 44.12% in 2013 to 30.03% in 2014.&#x201D; Further, they report that the significant reduction moves PayPal down in their ranking, with Visa now taking the top position as the most targeted financial services company. They point to DMARC as the likely reason for the decrease.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>So, after dedicating six years to the problem we set out to address, our commitment to combat fraudulent email is making a real difference. Something that started as another big idea became DMARC, and now we can see that it&#x2019;s clearly protecting our customers from spoofed domain attacks. And although this is only one of many types of attacks, it is satisfying to tick the checkbox as we shift our focus to our next big idea as we continue to aggressively protect our customers against all manner of attacks.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span></div>\n\n\t\t",

        "title": "Reaching Chinese Consumers in Seven Easy Steps",
        "publishDate": "2015-05-22T07:00:00.000Z",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong style=\"\">Melissa O&#x2019;Malley, Director of Global Merchant and Cross Border Trade Initiatives, PayPal</strong><br><br>The growing consumer demand in China is the topic of nearly every marketer or retailer. Countless experts have said these are the buyers to target. But how can local small business owners open a sales channel that is clouded by language barriers, cultural differences and shipping challenges?<br><br><span style=\"\"></span>At PayPal, we do more than provide payment processing that is fast, simple and secure. We also support business owners with tools and information to increase sales both domestically and internationally. Here are PayPal&#x2019;s top tips for reaching Chinese consumers in 2015.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">1. Ensure Your Supply Can Meet the Demand</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Shoppers made to wait weeks on end for their orders while you struggle to meet demand are not likely to recommend you to friends or purchase from you again. So before you do anything, ensure you have the ability to ramp up production. While this is true of any expansion, it&#x2019;s particularly crucial given the sheer population density of China.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">2. Stand Out with Free Shipping</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Our research shows that shipping cost is a major consideration for buyers - 46 percent of Chinese shoppers view free shipping as a must when buying from overseas online stores, and 50 percent feel the same about free return shipping. Offering free shipping can help your products rise above the rest.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">3. Focus on a Product Line that is Already in Demand</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Over the next year, Chinese shoppers are projected to increase spend across the board on products. That said, the top two categories for growth are leisure, hobby and outdoors goods (expected to grow 25 percent) and baby and children&#x2019;s supplies (expected to grow 21 percent). However, healthy/beauty, entertainment, and clothing, footwear and accessories aren&#x2019;t far behind (expected to grow 19 percent each). Here&#x2019;s the top ten list of the most popular products that Chinese consumers buy online from overseas:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>1) Clothing/apparel, footwear and accessories<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>2) Cosmetics/beauty products<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>3) Consumer electronics, computers/tablets/mobiles &amp; peripherals<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>4) Baby/children&apos;s supplies, equipment and accessories (excluding clothes/footwear)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>5) Jewelry/watches<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>6) Groceries, food, drink and alcohol (whether consumed inside or outside the home)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>7) Household appliances, household goods and furniture<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>8) Travel and transportation (e.g. hotel, tours, airline / train / bus tickets)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>9) Health products (e.g. bandages, over-the-counter medicine) and Entertainment/education(digital/downloadable/online)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>10) Entertainment/education (physical items)<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Make sure products in these categories are front and center when you market to Chinese shoppers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>UK retailers have a natural advantage over other European merchants. PayPal&#x2019;s research found that when Chinese consumers shop overseas, they&#x2019;re likely to buy from British sites, which ranked third in popularity behind only the US and Hong Kong.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">4. Go Mobile</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>China has the world&#x2019;s largest smartphone user base with over 521 million smartphone. When selling into China it&#x2019;s simply impossible to ignore m-commerce - 68 percent of Chinese online shoppers have purchased via mobile in the past 12 months and that number is expected to grow dramatically in the coming years. You&#x2019;ll likely fare better if you offer an app, as 59 percent of Chinese smartphone shoppers prefer them.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">5. Invest in Translations</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Nearly half (42 percent) of Chinese online shoppers said that having the website available in their language would encourage them to shop cross-border. By the same token, 46 percent cited &quot;different language of websites, product descriptions and customer support&quot; as a reason that they don&#x2019;t shop cross-border more often. While China does have a number of dialects, Mandarin is the primary language used on the mainland and will appeal to the largest number of potential buyers.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">6. Simplify Payment</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Chinese consumers that purchase cross-border are after convenience first and foremost &#x2013; 63 percent of them cite convenience as their main motivation for buying online (by comparison, only 47 percent of domestic-only online shoppers note the same for shopping online). So make information easily available, with clear and high-quality images. When it&#x2019;s time to check out, offer wallet-less options like PayPal.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">7. Know the Norms and Maximize the Mores</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Every culture has its own taboos, customs and sales peaks. In China, Singles Day (November 11<span style=\"\">th)&#xA0;</span>is the biggest retail opportunity of the year as single ladies and gents treat themselves by indulging in jewelry, clothing or electronics. In fact, it&#x2019;s the biggest retail day in the entire world, with over $10 billion having been spent in a 24-hour period.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In terms of customs, many are aware that red is considered an auspicious color but fewer are aware that writing a person&#x2019;s name in red ink is considered a sign of severing ties and should be avoided. Many Chinese shoppers also avoid buying items in sets of four, as the word for four in Cantonese sounds like the word for death. So when catering to Chinese customers, eschew sets of four in your packaging.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>China is one of the fastest-growing markets, and small business owners should not be intimidated by perceived complexity around regulations or not being able to connect with a new culture and customer base. By thoughtfully making small changes to business and marketing methods as well as taking advantage of the myriad resources available, entrepreneurs can easily navigate these international waters.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">[1]</span>Report: Global smartphone penetration to jump 25% in 2014, led by Asia-Pacific.

(NASDAQ: EBAY) announced today that it has agreed to acquire Braintree, the innovative global payment platform powering the next generation of leading online and mobile-first startups, for total consideration of approximately $800 million in cash.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;Braintree is a perfect fit with PayPal,&#x201D; said eBay Inc.

Once the acquisition is completed, Braintree will continue to operate as a separate service within PayPal under the continued leadership of Braintree CEO Bill Ready, who will report to PayPal President David Marcus. Braintree&#x2019;s management team and employees are expected to stay in place.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;PayPal was built on helping entrepreneurs grow great businesses online.

The take rate associated with Braintree&apos;s payment volume varies significantly based on business mix. Assuming the acquisition closes in late 2013, eBay expects the deal to be immaterial to its 2013 revenue guidance which it announced July 17, 2013, and to have a negative impact of $0.01 to its 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance and a negative impact of $0.01 - $0.03 to its 2013 GAAP EPS guidance.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>###<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">About eBay Inc.</strong><br>eBay Inc.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><em style=\"\">Wednesday, April 30, 2014</em><br><br><strong>PAYPAL IDENTITY LAUNCHED WITH MODERN, MOBILE-FIRST, OMNI-CHANNEL APPROACH</strong><br><br>&#xA0;SAN JOSE, Calif. &#x2014; PayPal has revolutionized the way people across the globe think about and use money. Today, PayPal announced transformational changes to its brand identity, including the unveiling of a new logo. The new look reflects PayPal&#x2019;s simplicity, convenience and security, redesigned for today&#x2019;s dynamic, mobile-first world. This is the first time PayPal has updated its identity since 2007.&#xA0;<br><br>&#x201C;Our new brand identity goes far beyond an updated logo,&#x201D; said&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal-media.com/executives/david-marcus?print=true\" style=\"\" title=\"\">David Marcus</a>, PayPal&#x2019;s president. &#x201C;We have aligned this with our first global brand campaign. We&#x2019;re setting a new expectation with our global consumers, developers and merchants: PayPal is redefining the future of money by putting people first. After all, money doesn&apos;t make the world go round, people do.&#x201D;<br><br>The brand identity, developed by award-winning design firm&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.fuseproject.com/\" style=\"\" title=\"\">fuseproject</a>, brings excitement with simplified forms and fresher colors, while building on the recognition of the current logo and signature double &#x201C;P&#x201D; shorthand for PayPal. The new brand expression better represents the growing needs of the mobile, real-world and online businesses that use PayPal and the company&#x2019;s position as innovator. The look and feel are designed for a world moving from desktop and mobile today, to a future where almost any device can deliver payment.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>New devices, from smart watches to connected eyeglasses, will one day let users transfer money from their wrists with one click or with literally the blink of an eye. This redesign creates a cohesive look and feel across the brand, affirming the trust consumers already have in PayPal. And because of its simplicity and flexibility it can be used anywhere, from smartphones to 72&#x201D; TVs.<br><br>&#x201C;PayPal is an iconic brand with equity well beyond its logo treatment,&#x201D; said Yves Behar, fuseproject&#x2019;s founder and CEO. &#x201C;PayPal is innovative and dynamic, and people interact with it as they do with a consumer-focused brand. The new logo reflects the notion of a pioneer, and will prepare PayPal to lead the industry as the intuitive way to transact on all devices in a non-techy fashion.&#x201D;<br><br>The new identity is both modernized and more visually compact, connecting with consumers in a friendly and elegant way. Four key elements deliver a new level of dynamism and impact designed to help PayPal better engage with consumers around the world and across devices: a stronger wordmark of the word PayPal set in modified Futura type, a new monogram of PayPal&#x2019;s double Ps, more vibrant colors, and a dynamic angle graphic. The wordmark and the monogram together lock up for PayPal&#x2019;s new signature.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Elements used in the redesign emphasize:<br>&#x2022;\tConnection<br>&#x2022;\tForwardness<br>&#x2022;\tPayPal&#x2019;s position as a visionary company<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Connection is a motivating principle behind the redesign &#x2013; connection to money, to people and between people.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The font used features a softened edge to emphasize that PayPal is a human, approachable brand. While blue has always been used in the logo, new colors &#x2013; a rich Indigo &#x201C;Pay&#x201D; blue and a vibrant &#x201C;Pal&#x201D; blue &#x2013; were selected to look better in today&#x2019;s high-definition world.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The Ps in the monogram overlap to emphasize the connection between people when they use PayPal. The Ps are designed to reflect PayPal&#x2019;s progressive and innovative leadership, while providing more &#x201C;pressability&#x201D; in everyday use.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The other common theme of the redesign is forwardness; the words and letters remain in italic &#x2013; like the former logo &#x2013; to reflect a forward-looking, visionary company. Forwardness is also communicated through the dynamic angle graphic.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The new identity will be applied globally, online and to all of PayPal&#x2019;s core applications, including checkout buttons, apps, PayPal Here devices, marketing materials and sales collateral. It also will appear in PayPal&#x2019;s new global brand campaign: &#x201C;Powering The People Economy.&#x201D; The multi-channel campaign will first be experienced in Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States and was developed by&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.havasworldwide.com/\" style=\"\" title=\"\">Havas Worldwide</a>.&#xA0;<br><br>For more information regarding the new identity visit&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/DMbrand\" style=\"\" title=\"\">http://bit.ly/DMbrand</a>&#xA0;and brand campaign visit:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/PPFbrand\" style=\"\" title=\"\">http://bit.ly/PPFbrand</a><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>###<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>About PayPal<br>At PayPal, we put people at the center of everything we do.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><em style=\"\">Tuesday, September 30, 2014</em><br><br>eBay Inc. today said its Board of Directors, following a strategic review of the company&#x2019;s growth strategies and structure, has approved a plan to separate the company&#x2019;s eBay and PayPal businesses into independent publicly traded companies in 2015, subject to customary conditions. Creating two standalone businesses best positions eBay and PayPal to capitalize on their respective growth opportunities in the rapidly changing global commerce and payments landscape, and is the best path for creating sustainable shareholder value, the company said.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;eBay and PayPal are two great businesses with leading global positions in commerce and payments,&#x201D; said eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe. &#x201C;For more than a decade eBay and PayPal have mutually benefited from being part of one company, creating substantial shareholder value. However, a thorough strategic review with our board shows that keeping eBay and PayPal together beyond 2015 clearly becomes less advantageous to each business strategically and competitively. The industry landscape is changing, and each business faces different competitive opportunities and challenges.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;eBay and PayPal will be sharper and stronger, and more focused and competitive as leading, standalone companies in their respective markets,&#x201D; Donahoe continued. &#x201C;As independent companies, eBay and PayPal will enjoy added flexibility to pursue new market and partnership opportunities. And we are confident following a thorough assessment of the relationships between eBay and PayPal that operating agreements can maintain synergies going forward. Our board and management team believe that putting eBay and PayPal on independent paths in 2015 is best for each business and will create additional value for our shareholders.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>As the company has previously stated, eBay&#x2019;s board of directors has a practice of regularly reviewing the company&#x2019;s growth strategies and structure, and assessing all alternatives. As part of such assessments, the board regularly explores the following questions: Will separation make eBay and PayPal more competitive? Will separation be possible without distracting innovation and execution? And, will separation create sustainable value for shareholders over time?<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In its recently completed review, the board concluded:<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">A changing competitive landscape creates enormous opportunities for eBay and PayPal; separation will create sharper strategic focus and better position each business to capitalize on those growth opportunities as independent companies. The pace of industry change and innovation in commerce and payments requires maximum flexibility to stay competitive and drive global leadership.</li><li style=\"\">The benefits of the existing relationships between eBay and PayPal will naturally decline over time and can be optimized in arm&#x2019;s length operating agreements between the two entities. Arm&#x2019;s length operating agreements can formalize the existing relationships between the two companies and capture ongoing synergies.</li><li style=\"\">This is the best path for delivering sustainable shareholder value. eBay is a leading global commerce platform that has benefited from PayPal, and PayPal is a strong, rapidly growing global payments leader because it has been part of eBay. But beyond 2015, eBay and PayPal will each benefit more and create greater value from the strategic focus, speed, flexibility and agility that come with being independent publicly traded companies.</li></ul><strong style=\"\">The future<br></strong><br><span style=\"\"></span>The company expects to complete the transaction as a tax-free spin-off in the second half of 2015, subject to market, regulatory and certain other conditions.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe and company CFO Bob Swan will be responsible for leading the separation of each business, with board oversight. This includes determining appropriate management and capital structures for eBay and PayPal, and putting in place appropriate operating agreements. Neither Donahoe nor Swan will have an executive management role in the new eBay and PayPal companies. But to provide continuity, they each expect to serve on one or both of the boards of the two companies.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The &#x201C;new&#x201D; eBay</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Devin Wenig, currently president of eBay Marketplaces, will become CEO of the new eBay company. As CEO of eBay, Wenig will lead the eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise businesses. Revenue over the last twelve months1 for these two businesses grew approximately 10% year-over-year to $9.9 billion, with eBay Marketplaces accounting for about $8.7 billion. eBay Marketplaces and eBay Enterprise collectively handled approximately $85 billion of gross merchandise volume and gross merchandise sales, which grew 13 percent year over year. Scott Schenkel, currently the CFO of eBay Marketplaces will become the CFO of the new eBay company.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>A global commerce leader with 149 million active buyers, eBay is one of the world&#x2019;s top 30 global brands and a top 10 retail global brand.2 Offering consumers worldwide extraordinary value and selection, eBay has more than 700 million live listings at any given time, and approximately 75% of sold items are new. eBay also is a leader in emerging competitive battlegrounds such as mobile and cross-border commerce. eBay has an installed mobile base of 200 million apps, generating $20 billion in mobile volume. Cross-border commerce represents 20% of eBay&#x2019;s gross merchandise volume and 61% of Marketplaces revenue is international.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;eBay has been a leading innovator in the world of commerce for almost 20 years; it&#x2019;s an incredibly special business,&#x201D; Donahoe said. &#x201C;Since joining eBay three years ago, Devin has proven to be an exceptional global leader and operating executive. He is steadily enhancing eBay&#x2019;s unique assets and capabilities and creating new commerce experiences to ensure long-term growth and commerce leadership. He will make a fantastic CEO of eBay.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The &#x201C;new&#x201D; PayPal</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Concurrent with the announcement of the business separation plan, the company also today announced the appointment of Dan Schulman to be President of PayPal, effective immediately, and CEO-designee of the standalone PayPal company following separation.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Schulman joins PayPal from American Express, where he was president of the company&#x2019;s Enterprise Growth Group. A seasoned leader in multiple industries, Schulman has held senior executive and CEO roles at AT&amp;T, Priceline and Virgin Mobile, prior to joining American Express.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;As both a leading global technology platform and a financial services business, PayPal requires a diverse blend of leadership skills and operating experience in its president and future CEO,&#x201D; Donahoe said. &#x201C;Dan has a proven track record of leading complex technology businesses at scale, driving sustainable growth and understanding how to innovate to drive competitive advantage and deliver compelling experiences for customers. I am thrilled to have him lead PayPal forward as a publicly traded, independent global payments leader, and we welcome him to the team.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal is a rapidly growing global leader in digital payments and the most trusted digital wallet, with more than 152 million active registered accounts. Accounts grew 15% year-over-year last quarter. Revenue over the last 12 months grew by 19% over the prior year period to approximately $7.2 billion.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>PayPal facilitates one in every six dollars spent online today. Total payments volume over the last 12 months increased by 26% to $203 billion, providing merchants and consumers worldwide a faster, safer way to pay and be paid. PayPal is fully localized in 26 currencies, is available in 203 markets worldwide and has relationships with 15,000 financial institutions. Representative of its global reach, PayPal is the No. 1 payments processor for business to consumer exports for Chinese merchants.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>With acquisitions such as Braintree and its new One Touch mobile payments experience, PayPal continues to lead and innovate in mobile payments. One Touch is the industry&#x2019;s first and only single touch payments experience. PayPal processed $27 billion in mobile payments volume in 2013. PayPal expects to process 1 billion mobile transactions in 2014.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">A strong record of delivering shareholder value</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Since 2008, eBay Inc.&#x2019;s board and management team have led a successful turnaround of the company&#x2019;s core eBay Marketplace business; have dramatically grown PayPal and drove digital payments innovation; and through 37 acquisitions have built a strong portfolio of global commerce and payments technologies, assets and capabilities.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The company&#x2019;s board and management team have a clear track record of making the right decisions for eBay and its shareholders.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;Together, eBay and PayPal have delivered substantial value creation for our shareholders,&#x201D; Donahoe said. &#x201C;We believe eBay and PayPal will continue to do so as separate, independent companies.

Access to clean water is a precursor to any economic development plan.

As part of its recent global rebrand, PayPal today announced findings from a 15-country survey aimed to understand both universal human attitudes and country-specific variances in perspectives about time, technology, money and other central elements of the People Economy.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;While we&#x2019;re not yet in the business of solving gridlock, we know that whenever we can shave time from the payments process for our 148 million active account holders, we&#x2019;re giving them back one of life&#x2019;s most precious resources&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>The People Economy is how PayPal describes its belief that people&#x2019;s lives can and should be more connected, more human, and filled with deeper meaning. People who make, share and collaborate, and those who buy, sell, and trade, all want the same thing: more of a say and less in the way. PayPal&#x2019;s continued technological innovation, focus on improved processes, and mission to give people direct control over their money are integral to the People Economy.&#xA0;<strong style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.peopleeconomy.com/\" style=\"\" title=\"\">PeopleEconomy.com</a></strong><strong style=\"\">&#xA0;serves as a place to discover and be inspired by the individual voices behind this growing notion.</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;At PayPal, we always strive to lead as a revolutionary brand. With our rapidly changing environment, we must create based on the needs and changes in the marketplace,&#x201D; said Christina Smedley, vice president, Global Brand and Communications, PayPal. &#x201C;With PayPal&#x2019;s truly global marketplace, better understanding the key values we&#x2019;re supporting around the world &#x2013; both at universal and at country-specific levels &#x2013; is essential for delivering products that further empower the people we serve. This survey furthers us in that mission.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">70 Percent of the World Thinks Technology Should Make Payments Simpler, Connected and Faster, with More Choices and Opportunities</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Whether it&#x2019;s the pain of the waiting on shopkeepers to take payment, annoyance at having to find and carry cash, frustration with lugging around a wallet, balking at reliance on kiosks or other things standing between people and what they want, the world is ready for what PayPal delivers: the faster, safer way to pay and get paid.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For example, in Singapore (73 percent), China (72 percent) and Australia (51 percent), the majority of people want technology to help them avoid long lines. European shoppers are more fed up with having to wait for someone to take payment or having to get cash to complete a purchase, with Spain (55 percent), Italy and Russia (53 percent), France and Turkey (41 percent) and the UK (39 percent) reporting the highest levels of dissatisfaction. The problems persist online as well; if a site requires a customer to sign up or register before making a purchase, they&#x2019;re apt to lose more than half of prospective sales in Italy (52 percent), Canada (51 percent) and Spain (50 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">The Majority of People Waste up to Four Hours a Day on Mundane Tasks; How it&#x2019;d Be Spent Varies Dramatically by Country</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Whether waiting in line/queuing to pay for things, commuting to and from work or sitting in traffic, enduring pointless meetings or calls, or simply running through the day&#x2019;s errands, more than half of the world (56 percent) wastes hours each day that they&#x2019;d like help recapturing. Only Germany has a significant percentage (19 percent) of its population that professes being highly efficient and wasting no time. By contrast, only two percent of Americans report feeling efficient.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For the rest of the world, getting to and from work and dealing with daily routines seem to be the biggest time-sucks, with every country averaging more than an hour on each. Italians, however, have the worst commutes, wasting more than two hours each day (123 minutes on average) followed closely by Israelis (117 minutes). Russians waste nearly three hours on errands each day (166 minutes), followed by Brazilians (125 minutes), Americans (118 minutes), the Chinese (115 minutes), and the Turks (112 minutes). In the US, being stuck in traffic and pointless meetings, calls and emails come in as a close, combined second for what we waste time on (22 percent each).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While the fact that we waste time on the days&#x2019; necessities may not be surprising, how each country would spend that time if given the chance varies from country-to-country. Of those wishing to spend more of that wasted time on worthwhile endeavors, Americans lead the world in ranking family time (54 percent) as the way they wish to spend more time, while, the Japanese want to treat themselves with solitude (63 percent), the Chinese seek more physical activity (48 percent) and Spaniards want more time for leisure activities (35 percent).<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>&#x201C;While we&#x2019;re not yet in the business of solving gridlock, we know that whenever we can shave time from the payments process for our 148 million active account holders, we&#x2019;re giving them back one of life&#x2019;s most precious resources,&#x201D; continued Smedley. &#x201C;Whether spending that time with family and friends, relaxing, exercising or getting some quiet solo time, the value is immeasurable.&#x201D;<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">Fast-Growing Economies Embrace Mobile</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>While keys lead the list of things people won&#x2019;t leave the house without, the smartphone is just as important &#x2013; beating cash and credit cards on a global scale. This statistic confirms for businesses that figuring out mobile payments is key to future sales. In fact, in some of the world&#x2019;s fastest-growing economies, the majority of the population has already embraced mobile payments. In China, 90 percent of respondents pay from their phone, followed by Russia (85 percent), Brazil (nearly 70 percent) and Turkey (60 percent). Even in China, however, where mobile is mainstream, 35 percent of respondents wish paying by phone were easier. The world is ripe for continued innovation.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>In the US, 54 percent say that small local businesses like farmers markets and local shops can benefit from mobile or online payments, and 49 percent believe American entrepreneurs overall would benefit from an easier flow of money.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>For more information about the survey findings and for infographics illustrating its findings, click here:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.peopleeconomy.com/\" style=\"\" title=\"\">www.PeopleEconomy.com</a><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">About the Survey</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Research was conducted April 29th to May 20th, 2014 by Reputation Leaders, an independent research firm, among 15,105 adult banked consumers aged 18 to 64 in 15 major markets. Interviews were conducted by RDD phone interviews in the US, and by online survey in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, and the UK. Respondents were balanced by quotas in each country to ensure the sample mix was representative of national adult populations by age and gender. Key findings show both universal beliefs that transcend boundaries, and country-level differences. The margin of error for the total sample of 15,105 adults is 0.8% at the 95 percent level of confidence. In each country of 1,000 adults interviewed, the margin of error is +/-1.3% at the 95 percent level.<br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">About Reputation Leaders</strong><br><span style=\"\"></span><br><span style=\"\"></span>Reputation Leaders Ltd is an international market research firm based in London that specializes in helping companies to build reputations through brand positioning, thought leadership and social purpose.
